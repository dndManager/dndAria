# Siridila

Siridila is the capital of Kingdom Stowinid. 
Set in the middle of a vast sea of prairie and wheat fields, 
the town is situated around a natural striking plateau with a castle atop
the plateau. 

The city is divided by quadrants starting 
with The Docks, a poor quadrant in the southwest, continuing counterclock-wise 
to Dwarftown, a modest quadrant in the southeast,
to The BD, a comfortable quadrant in the northeast, and
Le Plateau, a wealthy quadrant in the northwest. 




## The Docks

The poor quadrant known as The Docks which you suspect is because when it 
rains the rain all flows down to here and standing water stays for quite some 
time. 
There is a wooden Temple for Mystra (god of knowledge), 
with a 5-pointed star on front door.
Built into the side of the hill that leads directly up to the wealthy district,
a Tavern known as The Cave sits next to a brothel named The Shagger.

The Cave's barkeep is a human named Er Mavez, who has an extremely ugly face 
due to a plethora of moles. He is stout, but it appears difficult for him to 
lift even two steins with one hand. 
He treats guests rudely which you believe is a defense mechanism against him
being treated rudely. 

## Dwarftown

Dwarftown, the modest quadrant, is mainly inhabited by dwarves who typically work as 
day-laborers for those in the comfortable and wealthy quadrant. 
You see posts for jobs including posts that you recognize as Silver Mining 
Company posts, although the name is omitted. 
Each morning a crowd of dwarves gather near the Temple for Loviatar, a semi-stone 
building with a nine-barbed scourge added on to the roof line, to earn an 
honest days pay.

## The BD

This quadrant is primarily dedicated to businesses of good repute including 

- Alidris's map-making shop, named Telemnin & Fireforge, 
- leatherworking shop run by 
- a blacksmith run by ?

Fittingly there is a Temple for Tyr, god of justice, with huge mechanical 
balance scale afixed to the front. Many of the children use this scale as a 
playground and try to balance the scale with different children on each side.

## Le Plateau

Le Plateau, the wealthy quadrant, is surrounded by a stone wall.
On the side separating it from the comfortable district, this wall is 5 feet tall
while it is 10 feet tall otherwise.
A castle, sitting 60 feet atop the sheer vertical cliff face from The Docks,
rises an additional 3 stories and is the home of King Berold.

Le Plateau has a Temple for Myrkul, god of death. The temple is constructed to 
look like a human skull with an entrance through the mouth.
Townfolk have heard stories of animal and human sacrifices occuring at this 
temple.
Little else is known about the Le Plateau to folks outside of the 
quadrant due to strict guards and excessive punishments for being discovered 
within the quadrant.

# Ashud Minnin

Ashud Minnin, the mayor of The Crossroads, 
is a 6'5" human who stands extremely erect and wears a top hat
making him seem even taller.
You will typically find him near the town center greeting everybody by name and
welcoming visitors. 
Calling out a "Howdy Joe. Gosh darn its good to see you."
You will often here him "cursing" with a By Golly! or Oh Geez!

# Celine Hawkstone

The stable maid Celine has a remarkable resemblence to her father with her long
curly red hair and stout appearance. 
It is no surprise she is in charge of the stables due to her clear strength. 
It seems she may use her pure strength rather than any animal handling skills
as her clothing is absolutely filthy. 
She seems to often curse at the horses in an attempt to bend them to her will.
She can often be found on her rocking chair staring off into the distance at the
mountains.

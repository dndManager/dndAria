## [Timeline](timeline.html)

The adventurers have discovered two orbs: red and blue. 
Both orbs were apparently spawning monsters. 
They captured a blue orb and have placed it in the care of 
[Matilda](people/matilda.html) for the "Council of Elrond" meeting occurring
at EPIC during the fall of their second year. 
Alidris has also provided the Council with detailed maps of the locations 
where the orbs were discovered and a regional map of the relative positions.

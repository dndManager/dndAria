# D&D Aria

This is the setting for an adventure with 4 students at [EPIC](places/epic.html): Sevro, Vargan, Errich, and Alidris.
Boert joined the adventure by rescuing the crew from falling over a waterfall.
Sevro disappeared jumping into a termite mound that, for most of the adventurers
was a portal to the Fey Wild. 
Boert was abducted by an Invisible Stalker sent by his patron. 
Krotho was found in a dungeon encased in ice.

## [Timeline](timeline.html)

The adventurers have discovered two orbs: red and blue. 
Both orbs were apparently spawning monsters. 
They captured a blue orb and have placed it in the care of 
[Matilda](people/matilda.html) for the "Council of Elrond" meeting occurring
at EPIC during the fall of their second year. 
Alidris has also provided the Council with detailed maps of the locations 
where the orbs were discovered and a regional map of the relative positions.

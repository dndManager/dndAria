# The Red Badge of Pilferage, or: The Goblin with the Lava Tattoo

The gang avoided a large illuminated chamber and snuck around a side chambers with supplies.
While A summoned his spider familiar, E and S defended the gang's secret position from some unaware goblins looking for ale.
A used the spider to scout out the neighbouring room; it is an empty crypt.

The gang get drawn into a battle with several goblins and a hobgoblin.
They race through the large illuminated chamber, and then through a tunnel to a side chamber.
They manage to defeat the foes, and capture a goblin prisoner named Chit.

The side room has 10 sacks of mixed coins and a pile of arms and armour; none magical.
There are also tortured rabbits.
The goblin and hobgoblin bodies have a red symbol on the back of their necks in the form of a lava flow.

A performs a ritual to cast comprehend languages so that the gang can interrogate Chit.
Chit is very uncooperative, but reveals that there are many gobins in the tunnels beyond, and that we will be sorry when Grrkh (hobgoblin) returns.
Chit tries to escape, and V executes him.

The large chamber has a blocky statue, black with red veins, that looks like an elemental.
The statue bears the same symbol as the goblin necks.
There is a glowing red orb above the statue.
A determines that both the statue and the orb are magical.
There are many hidden tunnels leading into and out of the chamber.

# Sober Second Thought

The gang finish a long rest.
They figure out what kinds of questions to ask the invisible creature.
A casts Tongues on V, and V casts Speak With Dead on the corpse.

1. Why did you try to kidnap B? To take him to Baerfor.  
2. Why does Baerfor want B? Don't know; just instructed to take him.  
3. What evidence can you provide that you are telling the truth? None.  
4. Where were you taking B? Tooth-shaped mountain peak where the sun sets.  
5. What was to happen when B went there (in detail)? Meet Baerfor.

Cray knows about the mountain; it's about 1 day north.

After much discussion,
it'd decided that Cray and Drazda would head back to the Lizardfolk camp,
while the gang wou'd go to the mountain, in case there was a way to get home from there.
A writes a note for Illytheria.

They leave the basement and look north.
It's a full moon, and they can see the mountain; there are plains and a forest to cross before getting to it.
On their way down the plateau, 
B get's kidnapped again, and is flown away.
He agrees to go.
The gang wish him luck, and change their plans back,
returning to the basement with Cray and Drazda.

The gang go back to the smoke room.
They open the stone door (trapped with floor arrows),
and enter a short passage with a iron door at the end.
The iron is cold, and frosted.
On the other side is a room with three ice columns in the middle and a reinforced wooden door on the corner.
The iron columns are like ice stalagmites.
A sees eyes inside the columns;
there are creatures inside them.
V starts to chisel away at the ice.
This induces to the ice to break off and fly around the room;
they are ice versions of the ashy creatures they faced before.

A badger, fireball, and some arrows later, the creatures are defeated.
The fireball also melted the columns, revealing three humanoids:
a halfling, a dwarf, and an elf.
Only the dwarf is alive.
Looting their bodies yields 20gp and 5sp.

After a quick Healing Word,
the dwarf introduces himself as Krotho Stump, formerly of the Quicksmelt clan in the south.
The clan is known for making the finest breastplates.
He left (or was forced out of) since he wanted instead to make booze.
He appears to be an alcoholic.
He mentioned that he was in a brewer's town called Barrelhaven,
but A knows that Barrelhaven became Nederville (?) a few hundred years ago.

K relates the story of his capture:
a wizard did it.
In more detail: a wizard took him to a party (not an adventuring party, a party party)
where he blacked out on drink.
Since he doesn't normally black out from booze, it was probably foul play.
He remembers seeing the halfling and the elf at the party as well.
The wizard looked human, and was wearing purple robes with gold trim.
After some leading questions from V,
K's description of the wizard was consistent with the magic user at the death temple in Siridila.

The gang take K to the centipede room to rest, since he is exhaused (x5).
After a short rest themselves,
A, E, and V check out the other door in the cold room (which is not so cold anymore).
The door leads to another passage, 
with another reinforced wooden door at the other end, protected by ice darts from the wall.
They pass through the door into a room.
The room has a desk, with small barrel-like container on the ground,
and vials on shelves behind.
On the desk is a tome with a sword-carved (unknown) symbol (like a curved "V"?) on the cover.
A tries to open it, but cannot.

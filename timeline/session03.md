# The Big Bang Theory

Gang starts their day in Hama's shack, and converse over breakfast.
They learn that Hama is a monk from the Temple of Four Hands, which trains monks in hand-to-hand combat, though they didn't train Hama.
They learn the path to Grakas: 4 hours through the forest (north), and 4 hours along the river (west).
On the path on the river to Grakas and near Grakas, there is a path to the left, that leads to a cave in which Hama's former party left a cache.
In the forest north of the shack are harpies.

The gang heads out, and avoids the harpies about 2 hours north (only E couldn't resist their song, but he snapped out of it).
About an hour from the river, they hear an explosion about 4 hours to the west.
When they reach the river, they decide to turn west to investigate the explosion.

They travel 3 hours west (upriver) before the river bends south.
3000ft south of the bend, they encounter a pool at the bottom of a waterfall.
On the west bank of the river (across from the gang, about 60') both at the pool and at the top of the falls, 
are a group of 8 humanoids (5 dwarves and 3 humans), who were lowering boatloads of cargo (crates of shiny oar) down the falls.
They shot at the gang, hitting V, before the gang scolded them and retreated along a path upriver to the falls.

After a rest, the gang continued to walk along the river, which bent west from the waterfall.
Not far from there was a dock, north of which the gang heard clanking sounds (as of a mining operation).
There was one dwarf heading from the dock north along a path.

A used his unseen servant to steal a rowboat (with 4 oars) and row it back to the gang.

# Keep and Secrets

(On 18 Mar 2018)

The gang make sure the keep is clear.
Upstairs, there are a bunch of packs.
Downstairs, in the cellar, there is a bunch of debris, and apparently no traps or doors.

A & V begin depositing the bodies in the marsh.
S keeps a lookout.
E starts going through the packs.
He finds: 
- ep/gp/pp:
 - 19/20/8 in one room
 - 19/11/5 in another
 - 26/35/8 total upstairs
- some silver and copper

When V and A go out the window the escaping gnoll went through,
they are attacked by having three arrows fired at them.
They retreat, and V notices the arrows are not gnollish.
He yells at the attackers, and the gang discovers they are humans, 10 in total,
led by Frederick.
They are a posse of villagers from the surrounding villages, wearing leather armour,
meant to take out the gnolls.

The gang invite them in, but don't want to share any treasure with them,
so V and S keep them busy keeping watch and taking gnoll bodies to be dumped into the marsh.
Meanwhile,
the gang loots the keep,
but leaves the silver and copper available to the posse.

A finds an old diary from the library.
When the gang enter the armour room,
they are attacked by the living armour, the rug, and a dancing sword.
The gang destroy them in the ensuing melee.

# Dwarven Disappointment, or: Burning Questions

E checks that the secret bookcase door has no traps.
V swings the door left to open it.
V enters a large room with a bed, shelving with supplies, a dresser,
two doors (apparently with barred windows, but the windows are boarded up) on either side,
and a wooden commode.
There is a single, disheveled, unarmoured dwarf
practising with a dagger on a wooden post (training dummy),
apparently playing out some fantasy in his head.
The room that smells like buckets of excrement,
because it actually contains buckets of excrement.

V speaks to the dwarf in dwarven, but he apparently doesn't speak it.
The dwarf asks if V was sent by Mr. V,
and V pretends that he was, and the gang enter the room.
Through some questioning, the gang learns:
- The death temple leader is named Venmo
- The dwarf's name is Gingruil Shatterfinger (but goes by "you")
- He is from Siridila
- He used to work on the docks, but Venmo offered him 100gp to tend some fires for 3 months
- He is about 2 months in
- He gets paid when he goes back
- He passes the time talking about marrying Krorsaebera (another dwarf in Siridila)
- He is about 50 years old
- He is not very bright
- He was brought here with a sack on his head; he didn't even know that the bookcase opened

V and A try to convince him that he will not be paid, and that instead Venmo will probably kill him.
V tries very hard to proselytize Gingruil (both to worshipping the Storm Lord and to bolshevism).
He seems too dim to understand either.
V asks if his trip to the Feywild might have affected his intelligence,
but A assures him that it likely did not.

Gingruil gives the gang a tour.
The two doors each lead down a short hallway to a room with fires burning in the middle.
Above the fires are large, heavy pots;
one room has pots emitting steam, the other room's pots emitting smoke.
The gang figures that these seep into the smoke room and the steam room
to serve as the environment for the mephits.
The steamy pots room has piles of coal nearby,
while the smoke pots room has piles of wood in an adjoining hallway (that ends in a cave-in).
It is Gingruil's job to keep the fires burning.

The gang investigates the rooms while K rests on the bed and drinks beer with Gingruil.
For some reason, during this time, E decides to empty one of the buckets into one of the fires.
V discovers that the lower 2' of the wall behind the commode is newer and thinner than the rest of the wall.
He chips away at it and discovers a false wall (secret passage).
He chisels through it and through the opposite wall.

The room on the other side is dark; A casts Dancing Lights to find a very large room with 15' tall ceilings.
It has four statues of humanoids,
and some scrambling creatures.
The gang (minus K) enter the room, and try in various languages to indicate that they are not threats.
But in the end, they are attacked by little blue creatures (xvarts, known by A to be cruel creatures) 
and their pet (?) giant rats.
A kills one with Magic Missiles (and finds 8ep on its person),
and E eliminates the rats.
The remaining 5 run away through a door on the far wall.

V,E, and A chase them through the door, and through a dark passage around a corner.
The passage has several small holes into which they escape.
E gives chase through the hole, led by dancing lights, and A and V squeeze in after.
The hole is the entrance of an earthen tunnels that slope upward to the tall-grassy surface.
When E pops his head out, he is attacked by the xvarts and injured badly.
He throws a fuzz ball from the bag of tricks into the air,
and a dire wolf appears.
It lands on two of the xvarts and kills one other, causing the remaining two to flee.
The pinned xvarts try to flee, but one is recaptured.
Nobody is able to communicate with it,
so it is looted for 17gp
before the dire wolf eats it.
E sends the wolf out to hunt the remaining ones.
(Perhaps it should be named Hunter, or Lando.)

E, A, and V return to the statue room.
They find a (trapless) secret door, that they cannot open.
On each side of the door are three tall candle holders, each with a magic candle.
The candles look like they have been lit recently,
but the wax doesn't melt.
The gang lights the candles,
discovering that
each flame has a colour
(from left to right): blue, green, yellow, red, orange, purple.
The candles can be removed from the holders.

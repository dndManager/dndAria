# Of Wolves and Monks

It's the end of summer, and the gang are stuck in a forest without their gear, instructed to find their way back to EPIC.
They have:  
* A satchel, containing:
  * a dagger
  * padded armour (small, Dex+11, disadv on stealth)
  * an empty water canteen (2 gallons)
* A's spellbook
* V's holy symbol

E manages to find/craft a club (1d4) and a staff (1d6/1d8).
They use the distant mountains to get their bearings and head toward EPIC, relying on E to sneak their way through the woods.
They manage to avoid most encounters (?), but spend some time getting clean water.
They hunt an elk, and A takes it down with a magic missile.
They skin the elk for hide, and cook the meat to carry with them.

Overnight, they are ambushed by wolves.
A throws meat at them to distract or appease them. 
V howls to try to intimidate them or drive them away.
Then follows a slapstick comedy routine involving climbing up and down trees, failing st doing so, and jumping on the backs of wolves.
S goes down but is healed, A and V go down, and the gang are rescued by Hama.

Hama takes the gang to his shack in a clearing with a chicken coop.
He says that Halgruk is a fair guy.
He informs the gang that they are 2 days from EPIC, with Grakas half a day earlier.

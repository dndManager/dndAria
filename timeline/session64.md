# Uplift and In Spire (stub)

The gang learn the habits of the hobgoblins.
They fly around high in the dark and discover (using Locate Object) that the orb is within the spire, about half way up.
They wait for the boss to be alone, and then attack, killing him.
They break the spire and retrieve the orb.
Off camera, they defeat the remaining hobgoblins, goblins, and wargs.

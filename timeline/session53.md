# I Spy With My Little Eye

The sun is starting to rise.
The gang (along with Drazda and Cray) leave the unicorns and return across the grassland to the forest.
They encounter the pixies again, and E goes to greet them.
The gang give them information about the plateau and Venmo,
and they give K a blowgun.

When they re-enter the forest, Cray takes the lead.
They feel eyes on them, probably dryads.
They use well used paths, and (as before) spot sparkling lights flitting by.
None of these forest creatures and guardians seem to be hostile to the gang anymore.

The gang return to the lizardfolk settlement, and meet with Bossman Kiuz.
They learn:
- The dwellers of the forest get along because of a convergence of interests.
- The hags are a nuisance, and the others are opposed to them.
- When he was young, he heard stories that there was no marsh at all,
and that its occurence was relatively sudden.
- The marsh appears to be slowly receding, as the forest slowly reclaims the space.

The gang decide to free some more halflings.
Kiuz provides the gang with a map of the forest.
The gang ask him to provide scouts around the forest in case the gang sends freed halflings that way.

A uses his broom to scout for targets above the fog.
Past the large tree that the gang burned down,
there is an extra large tree, with seven or eight large trees around it,
several hundred feet apart.
The gang swing north to the edge of the grassland,
and follow it until they get as close as they can to the nearest unburned tree.

Using A as a periodic scout, the gang enter the marsh.
They pass a bunch of smaller trees,
but eventually encounter a 15' high stone platform, likely the one that Drazda used.
It is unnatural, worked stone, pretty straight, with a flat top and no markings.
V goes underneath the water, and finds that the stone doesn't go past the moss,
and so weirdly floats.
K goes to the top, and it is flat.
He spots a raven.

The gang proceed to the tree.
The raven returns, and E kills it with a well aimed arrow.
It doesn't vanish like a familiar; 
instead, its body falls to the ground.
In its claws is something like an eye, with a hard outer shell.
V puts it in a sack and sends A away, and the rest of the gang discuss it.
They decide to keep it in the sack, to break at a moment's notice or even to trade halflings for it.

When they get to the tree, there is no visible door.
About 15' up there is a closed window.
They find the door on the other side.
K pretends to be a peddlar, but to no avail.
V starts to hack at the door,
but K just opens it.

K checks for traps, and finds that the hallway was walls that will crush those who pass through.
Everything else seems normal.
A stays outside while the rest of the gang enter.
The basement is flooded like before,
and the gang use a table to block that escape route.
There is nothing in the kitchen or dining room worth taking at a glance.

E, K, and V go up the stairs.
E scouts the rooms, and finds no hags, but does find 21gp, 8cp, a ring, and an elixir.

The trap door to the attic is not latched, but it doesn't budge.
K taps the door pretending to be a peddlar, but doesn't work.
K and V push the trap door open, and they find three hags, one of whom is holding a halfling girl hostage.

A battle begins.
V casts spiritual weapon to attack the hostage taker,
and, since it was too late for negotiations, tries (but fails) to break the eye.
K stuns one hag and attacks the hostage taker.
E tries to shoot the hostage taker (?).
The hags snuff out the lights, and let go of the girl, and try to cast some spell on each member of the gang.
V tosses the eye on the floor and casts shatter on it and one of the hags.
The eye breaks, and blinds the hags.
K moves like lightning attacking two hags.
The hags vanish.
E produces a badger to guard the door.
V casts Spirit guardians, and steps just out of the room.
K runs into an invisible hag, and continues to punch.
Two of the hags start to feel the effects of the guardians, and one dies.
E shoots blindly.
Another hag falls, and the remaining hag begs for mercy.

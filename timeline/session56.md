# (A-ri-a!) Say, Do You Remember...?

The gang make their way to a large (~200'x100') town square where the announcement is to be made.
There is a fountain in the middle.
A stage is set up on one (short) end.
A rope across the middle separates the dwarves (in the back) from the others, 
though dwarves of note seem to be classified as others.
In conversation with Alfgar, A learns that he hasn't faced discrimination,
though anti-dwarf sentiment has always been present, 
and has been getting more stark.

A gong sounds.
The dragonborn walks onto the stage first, followed by an entourage of human guards.
Then comes MrV, followed by the two wizards, including the one thought to be killed by V.
Third comes a tough-looking human fighter, followed by some others.
Finally, the Lord of Siridila, Thio Waterless, walks on stage, followed by his wife and three children.
The eldest, Thio II, is who the gang met.

Thio is a tall human with greyish orange hair.
He speaks through a megaphone in a weak voice.
He reminds people of the upcoming marriage (in 3 months) of Thio II to Desq Duquevial, daughter of the head of the dynasty.
Preparations are to be made for "the best wedding ever", and help is needed.
It will be "the biggest parade ever" to the wedding location at Duquevial.
The biggest float will be for Thio, while the second biggest will be for his son.

The dragonborn takes the stage.
He says there is lots of work to do.
Starting at 8am tomorrow, workers are expected to meet outside the docks,
an guards will assign tasks.
There are plenty of tasks for everyone.

During these announcements, E spotted MrV rolling his eyes once.
Thio II looked indifferent throughout.
Those on stage leave.

The gang splits up: A and E go to A's home, and K and V go to the docks to stir up trouble.

A wakes up Matilda.
He casts Dispell Magic on MrV's spellbook.
It's almost a magic lab notebook of elemental spells.
He sees that there are three completed spells therein:
Conjure Minor Elemental, Conjure Major Elemental, and Create/Destroy Water.

E has a conversation with Matilda.
She feels guilty for what happened at EPIC.
Halgruk started not showing up; 
he would disappear for days at a time, and return drunk and beat up.
It fell to her to be head of EPIC.
She started paying less attention to the council.
Wizards and sorcerers learned how to control the orb;
they could change the colour to get different creatures out of it.
This caused a rift in the council between those who wanted to use the orbs and those who wanted to destroy it.

At this point, the orb was stolen and taken north.
Matilda chased after it.
She was hunting a person dressed in black, on a black horse, and the horse had a head of a stallion tatooed on 
the back of its neck.
She followed the trail to Siridila before she lost it.

EPIC is no longer friendly, students and faculty have begun to leave.

Meanwhile, 
K goes to the Cave and finds some worn down dwarves to sit with.
There is a throng of dwarves coming in from the rally.
K buys some rounds of drinks and starts some conversations,
first (futilely) in dwarvish, and then in common.
The dwarves see him as somewhat fancy, with his multiple sets of clothes.

V goes to the temple of Mystra, and finds it empty and unused, without a caretaker.
He then goes to a square, steps on a soapbox, and begins shouting slogans.
V tries to convince the dwarves to form a union-like clan, and to engage in industrial sabotage,
all while doing the storm lord's work.
He is beginning to have some success, even getting some to sing a dwarven work song
about exploitation.
He goes back to the Cave with K, and they talk about trying to form a vanguard and distinct cells for sabotage.
They return to A's home.

V convinces Matilda to begin occupying the temple of Mystra and working with the dwarves of the docks.

V casts Sending, and talks to Halgruk.
He is drunk, and talks about how he just wants Aria back.
The gang talk to Matilda about this and learn:
- Aria was the previous headmistress, and was a druid.
- She went on a quest with some students (2nd years) a few years ago, and was captured by Pharas.
- She went to the lands NE of EPIC.
- The Duquevial Dynasty is in a mountainous area on the coast, well protected.
It has colonies on the other side of the sea, from which its wealth of oils and spices flows.
The quest was near the main castle of the dynasty.
- Pharas is a sorcerer, no one knew he was there.
- When the party went there, they encountered some creatures that kepts spawning (as with the orbs).
They were surprised, and many were killed (like Niven and Wilbur) while a few returned (like Hama).

They also learn:
- The council was composed of elders and nobles, including someone from Siridila, and a representative from the DD.
- DD got a new king about a year ago.
- DD's queen, Thocha D, is the mother of Desq.
- Siridila is the eastern part of a kingdom, and controls the surrounding area.
- The lord of Siridila owns the SMC.

V casts sending on Thio II, to ask about the wedding.
It is largely unsuccessful, but the gang plan to groom him into an ally or a contact.

The next few weeks, the gang plans to do the following.
- A wants to work on his business, and map the planes.
- E goes to the Cave to see if the agitation is working.
He hears little about the storm lord or rebellion, 
but hears a lot about rumours about jobs.
 - Thio wants silvermine workers and workers to build an aquaduct.
 - Workers are melting down arour and weapons for nails and other building materials.
 - Workers are wanted to chop wood for the floats.
 - Brewers are also wanted.
- K wants to experiment with brewing.
- V wants to agitate, form cells and a vanguard.

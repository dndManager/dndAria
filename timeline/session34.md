# Into the Green Wall

Leafland is 2 days north of Siridila.
The gang leaves in the morning, spending the night at town or village enroute. 
They leave Ferris Muler at the nearest town.
During the journey, the gang discusses their backgrounds and adventures, but don't mention the orbs.
They learn from E about Leafland, and especially the unusual nature of Leafland.

When they arrive at Leafland in the morning, they are confronted by a green wall of vegetation, 
apparently inpenetrable.
There are two human traders there,
perhaps waiting for a guide.
The gang leaves them.

E hops into the green wall and disappears.
He then pokes his head out and calls the gang in.
One of the traders, seeing this, runs to E and offers monet to be guided through Leafland.
His name is Bolveg, and he is a messenger for the Duquevial Dynasty, and he offers 5gp.
Running after is the other human, Sidgir, who has a feather in his cap and carries a sack.
Sidgir is apparently an ecotourist from Sirenchester (?) up north and west.
He offers 20gp.
E agrees.

Travelling through Leafland is a three-dimensional affair, and is very difficult without a guide.
E leads the way.
He runs into his friend Norbin. 
Asked about the missing child who returned, Norbin knows only that it was Ria, it was 6 months ago, 
and Tevon (an elder) would know more.
E passes the humans off to Norbin (without even asking for the money),
but not before S looks inside Sidgir's sack (it has ecotourism gear)
takes his (red and white striped) feather.

The gang head to the center of Leafland, to the Tree of Life, where Tevon lives.
They arrive by midday, 30' above the ground.
There are many Leaflanders there, as this is a sort of hub.
The gang goes up the tree to see Tevon,
but it is his wife Qumita who gives them information:
> Ria is from the southwest.
> She doesn't remember very much.
> She was playing down near the southern cave (Shiloh Cave)
> and went in (despite the taboo against into the caves or underground at all).
> The next thing she remembers, it was 2 years later.
> She looks like she hasn't aged, though her clothes looked worn, and she was wearing a different belt.

The gang goes southwest to see Ria, and it takes them the rest of the day to get there.
They run into Ria's 13yo brother Janvin, who knows where Ria and her parents are, and takes the gang to them.
Ria was 19 when she disappeared, and still looks 19, though she is 21 (?),
and is with her mother, Regrace.
When questioned about why she went to the cave, Ria was evasive, and said it was stupid.
The gang (minus V) takes her for a walk, and V stays with Regrace.

The gang learn that Ria doesn't want to get Valmo, a young Leaflander elf-woman, in trouble.
Valmo dared her to go into the cave, and that's why she went in.
She has unpatterned scars (from cuts) on her arms.
She also went in with a tattered green belt, but came out with a blue belt (normal make, weird colour).
The gang trade a piece of robe for her belt.

Meanwhile, V and Regrace discuss Umbo, and she is intereted.
She describes the nature of storms rolling in from the north.

When the gang reunite, they make camp for the night.
They go back to the Tree of Life and ask Tevon about Valmo's whereabouts,
learning that she typically hangs out near Shiloh Cave.
They go there, and wait the rest of the day, but there is no sign of Valmo.
They return to the Tree of Life and begin to ask widely about her.
The next day, they learn that she hasn't been seen for a few days.
The gang return to Shiloh Cave and switch tactics.
There is a place near Shiloh Cave with four (?) families (with children) that are relatively stationary.
The gang find 12 kids who are apart from their parents at the moment.
One of the kids saw Valmo yesterday, and takes them there.

The gang spot Valmo.
E chases her, and grabs her, but she breaks free.
Despite only wanting to talk to her, 
she disappears (no sign even of her passage).
The gang rushes to Shiloh Cave (like a giant termite mound with many holes), and spots her entering one of the holes.
The gang follows, and disappears.

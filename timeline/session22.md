# Adventures in Babysitting

Morning of the 4th day, 
the gang continues north toward Leafland.
They see two individuals down a trial to the east and start to approach,
but quickly realize they don't seem to be moving.

A has studied petrification a bit and realizes that a number of animals 
can petrify including cockatrice, basilisk, and gorgon. 
He also remembers that there is a sixth level flesh-to-stone spell.

E sends a badger from the bag of tricks to investigate but the badger 
disappears into the grass on
the right side past the statues and stops.
Team sends a giant rat, Ratrick Ratterson, 
from the bag of tricks to strut in front of (what turn out to be) the petrified farmers.
There are 4 cockatrices.
The Ratrick does an incredible job avoiding and tanking hits while providing
S with sneak attack.
The cockatrices are defeated.

The gang finds a male and female farmer who have been petrified apparently this 
morning as their tracks are fresh.
A takes hands, heads, feathers, and some eggs from within the hens bodies.

Venturing further on the trail, 
the gang finds a farmhouse with 3 children: 
boys aged 5 years and 6 months and a 3 year old girl.
The boy tried to defend the farmstead,
but finally agrees to disarm.
The children were expecting their parents, but haven't seen them.
The gang decides to bring these children (with their okay) to a neighbors' house
(a couple of miles away; where they stayed the night before), 
but they find out from the children that it is likely the neighbors won't be 
back for a week, since they went to market in the Crossroads.
The gang avoids the statues en route, so as not to alarm the children.

The next morning E and V decide to go get the cows and some fencing
(from the [ogre ransacked farm](20180218.html)) and bring them to this farmhouse,
while A takes care of the kids and S sits in a rocking chair on the 
porch.

Later that day the children's father comes running down the path.
Apparently the petrification only lasted 24 hours.
> Errich: Thank you for coming Mr and Mrs...?  
> Father: Stone. Peter Stone. And this is my wife, Gemstone.  
> Mother: Gemstone Stone. Nice to meet you.
The gang reunits the children with their parents and bring them 20 head of 
cattle with fencing.
They fence a pasture for the cows.
They spend the night at the Stone's farm.

The team heads to north for a day,
to The Crossroads where a market is currently in progress. 
They decide to get a mule.
On the way to purchase it,
a gnome named Bart runs up to Sevro and says 
"hey man, what is going on? long time no see!".

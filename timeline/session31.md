# Elementary Encounters

It's about 10pm in the Cave.
S tries the secret door again, but can't get in.
The gang wait for the noble to return.
After 40 minutes, he does, with a mistress.
The gang follows in the shadows, with S close behind the noble.

S hears the noble say the password: "miracle".
The door opens, and S sneaks in with the pair.
On the other side, he sees a nicely lit tunnel, with good stonework, leading up.
There is a doorman there, and an iron bar across the door locks it.
The noble, mistress, and doorman go up the path.
S opens the door, and the gang enter, and go up the tunnel.

There are two ways forward: 
the well lit tunnel continues going up, rising quickly;
and a dim tunnel with rougher stone, descending.
The gang descends.

The dim tunnel becomes just cut stone and earth.
After about a quarter mile, there is a fork:
the tunnel continues ahead, and there is a dim light there;
and a dark tunnel to the right.
The gang hears a clanking sound approach from the dim light ahead.
The duck into the dark tunnel and wait.
They see, walking by, 
a person clad in nice plate armour, with red streaks on the helmet.
A guard, apparently.
S gets a closer look:
the person is not human, but is scaley with red flares.
The gang proceeds into the dark,
with E (absent his gear) in V's backpack.

After many twists and turns, and killing a giant spider,
they spot a set of footprints leading further.
They are confronted by a creepy creature, roughly in the shape of a human, 
but with three-fold symmetry about the vertical axis,
and a mouth with sharp teeth on top of its head,
and a single eye underneath its mouth.
The creature seemed agitated, 
but A (casting Tongues) talked it down.
It demanded money, so the gang gave it some copper.
That wasn't enough; it wanted gold, or more metal.
The gang told it about the plated-armoured guard ("metal man"), 
and the creature left.

The gang continued through the tunnel, which gently sloped down.
It opened into a large, dark cavern.
Lighting an arrow, the gang saw the cavern was 100' in diameter,
with a dome shaped ceiling 80' high.
The floor was dominated by a large pool, covering most of the cavern, 
but for an earth/rocky path along the cavern walls,
and a pedestal-like rocky island rising in the center.
The island was 10' in diameter at contact with the pool, 
but flared up to 30' in diameter at its top, which was about 30' above the pool.
Water dripped from the ceiling onto the island.

The water was weird: 
it was rising and falling in places (it wasn't flat),
and it was ebbing and flowing (but not like tides).
It moved unlike water; it was more viscous.
The gang figured out that this was a pool of water elementals.
A (using tongues) began talked to Blublub (Blooblub),
who explained that there were many water elementals here,
and they were brought here by "the master" 
(a humanoid of some sort).
(When asked about Umbo, Blublub described memories of big waves,
lots of elementals in waves.)

The gang made their way back to the dim tunnel,
and followed it to the source of light.
After about a half hour,
they saw the entrance to a well lit room with voices in idle chatter and glasses clinking.
S determined that the room was about 20' square, 
with a fire on the right side,
a game table with chairs and people on the left side,
and a passage on the far side.
The gang snuck past these guards
(using some spell; Fog Cloud?)
to the passage.
After a jog right, left, and right again,
they found themselves in a hole in a field of boulders outside the city,
by (in?) a sheer cliff.
They returned to the tunnel, 
passed the guards again,
and made their way back to the well lit tunnel going up,
near the beginning.

On their way up, 
there are switchbacks (15' back and 15' forth).
At the end of the tunnel are wooden doors with iron grating at the top.
Past this is a hallway with four doors (2 left and 2 right), with the hallway continuing around the corner.
2 of the doors are open, and inside are implements of torture.
These look like they used to be prisons or torture chambers, but are repurposed as bedchambers.
The gang hears screaming from one of the doors;
V surmises that they are from a prostitute, and they are screams of ecstasy.

They continue past the rooms and around the corner.
The hallway ends at a heavy, wooden door.

# No Way In

The gang rows across the river and take a silver ore rock.
S and E sneak along the path north of the docks and discover a clearing with several tents (the nearest being the biggest).
Beyond the clearing are hills, where the clanking can be heard.
After some investigating by S, there is a human in the main tent, and some dwarves around the clearing.
The gang decides not to mess with the operation, and goes back to the river, and row back downriver towards Grakas.

They carry the boat down the path to clear the waterfall, and then row downriver for 2 hours, arriving at the path they took north from Hama's shack.
They float the remaining 4 hours to Grakas.
(It was at this point where they encountered an SMC boat (the same kind as the gang stole), 
where A creeped out the rower using his unseen servant and other tricks?)
Just before getting to Grakas, they find docks on the north bank.
They take the boat inland and walk it past the docks and Grakas.

The gang arrives at the path Hama told them about, and take it south.
They find a big oak near the mouth of the cave, and hide the boat.
E stays outide in a tree, while A and S go in the cave.  V squeezes his way in.

Inside they find an area with dusty shelves, chairs and a table.
"Niven" and "Wilbur" are etched into the wall;
S recongizes these as gnomish names.
At the far end of the cave is a tunnel, protected by a giant spider.
They dispatch a spider, and find the tunnel leads to another area with two open chests, one sealed chest, and a hole in the wall.
Inside the open chests the gang found: a magic cap with a metallic ear-shaped pin (an eavesdropping cap), and 25cp.

Meanwhile, outside, E is attacked by a giant bird. He evades it, and heads to the cave opening.

Inside, the gang finds that the sealed chest is secured to the ground.
Without thieves' tools, there seems to be no way for S to open it.
A uses his familiar to scout out the hole twice: it is killed both times, but the second time reveals a rat's nest with 3 giant rats.
V uses a spider leg to lure them out, and the gang dispatches them.
They decide to return to the cave once they get thieves' tools,
and head back to Grakas.

Grakas is a walled city on an island in the river.
The main gate is on the north side, where a 10' high bridge connects the city to the main road heading north.
A secondary gate is on the south side, connected to the south bank by a 30' high bridge.
There are guard houses on the banks at the bridges.
Around the north gate are what appear to be some merchants heading into the city.
At the south gate are 3 beggars.
V gives each 8cp, but none have any information.
They try in vain to get into the city, but a letter or badge is needed.
A recalls that a cartographer colleague is in the city, but declines to use that contact.
The gang give up, and head downriver to EPIC.

When they arrive the next day, they learn from Halgruk that they are the 3rd of 4 teams to arrive.
They learn that SMC stands for Silver Mining Corporation, run by Henrik.
The gang can expect to go on a resupply mission to Grakas in a few weeks.

# Bring Them All Back

A flies to the creature, and pours ink on it.
It is now visible.
During the battle, A attacks it (sword and Magic Missle), B tries to communicate with it, E shoots it, and V occasionally casts Sacred Flame.
A eventually grapples B, and B breaks free of the creature.
The creature attacks A, causing him to lose concentration, and he and B fall 75' to the ground.
A goes unconscious, while B survives.
E jumps throws a giant badger from the Bag of Tricks to the base of the cliff, and jumps down to land on it.
(Maybe the giant badger's provisional name is Browder.)
V gets A up with Healing Word,
B uses his Vampiric Touch on the creature,
and E shoots it dead.
The gang find 150g on the creature.

They decide to take the body back to the cave to interrogate it (using Speak With Dead, after a rest).
It is starting to get dark, and the moon is becoming visible.
On their way back up, they spot Drazda and Cray leaving, about 600' away.
V uses Thaumaturgy to call out to them, failing to mimic A's draconic message.
But they do seem to stop.
So E and B rush towards Drazda and Cray, while A and V walk towards them.

Along the way they see a lage moving figure.
It has a hunched back, and a mouth full of teeth: a giant hyena.
E sends a dire wolf from the Bag of Holding towards it.
A few good shots by E and the beast falls.
A, B, and E convince Drazda and Cray to hole up in the centipede room.
V loots the giant hyena body for meat.

The gang prepare to rest in the centipede room.
E and V investigate the corridors and rooms that the gang have already seen,
and spot what look like two secret doors opposite one another in the first room.

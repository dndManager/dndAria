# Scales and Scalps

The gang scalps the three lizardfolk, dry the scalps, and complete their rest.
E tracks the ones that retreated, and the tracks diverge.
The gang follows the ones that go north.
The tracks turn west, joining a bunch of lizardfolk tracks, into a bright forest with giant flowers.

The gang sees a puff of smoke ahead.
They pause.
Suddenly, vines from the ground attempt to seize them.
They are confronted by voices, who, after A casts tongues, are revealed to be dryads, guardians of the forest.
They reveal little useful information (though they know about halflings),
but let the gang go.

The gang continues along the path and, hearing crashing ahead, are ambushed by 4 lizardfolk,
two in trees and two on the ground.
They kill the ones in the trees, drive the other 2 away, and scalp the fallen ones.

The gang find their way back to the hag tree.
They are followed by a raven, the hag's familiar.
When they get their, V gives her the three dried scalps and one of the fresh ones.
They are invited in.
V, B, and E go in; A waits in the door's entrance.

There are stairs up and down, a kitchen, and a dining room.
The hag tries to get the gang into the dining room, but V notices something off about it
(a seam along the floor),
so they chat in the kitchen.
B banters with the hag, and they learn that she is Hagatha, and another hag is Christy.
There is a third (Valmo?).
The hag is being evasive.

# Dead Wood

The halfling girl is named Nedda.
She tells E that she's been gone for 2 months.
Valmo led her to Shiloh Cave, told her to peek inside, and pushed her in.
Valmo then fell on top of her on the moss.
Valmo bagged her head, and marched her there.
The next thing she knew, she was in the attic,
and didn't see Valmo again.
She never left the attic.
The hags would give her porridge once in a while.
The hags force her to do menial work, especially sewing and darning.

A and V go looking for the dead hag, but she was dragged away by the surviving hag.
They follow the tracks for 200' before they disappear into a hole under the moss.
A looks into the water, and sees one swimming away, dragging the other.
They return to the tree.

B loots the tree.
He finds no secret way up above the attic, and takes the spinning wheel's needle.
He raids the kitchen for a variety of liquids, charcoal, and herbs.
He raids the bedrooms and finds:
- leftmost room
  - coins (110cp, 43sp, 5gp)
  - an extensive pile of papers in a makeshift desk: a play, written in common
- middle room
  - 2 gems (uncut, raw, cloudy white) in an underwear drawer
- rightmost room
  - A mask (black, scaly, with large horns curving back) on a wall
  
A climbs the tree.
The fog gets more dense, and then lightens up.
After about 130', he is above the fog.
At the top of the tree, he can see the cloud layer below, clear blue sky above, sun at noon position.
There are distant mountains to the east.

The gang reassembles in the tree.
A casts Detect Magic and Identify.
There is nothing new magical in the tree except the mask:
it is a Mask of Horn and Scale (immune to fear if ally is scared; can cause fear including damage).
V identifies the gems as chalcidony (50gp each).

V investigates the basement: it basically empties into the water below.
A casts light on a piece of the cauldron, and drops it into the water.
It slowly disappears into the deep.
B sends Smokey, his eel familiar, into the water to investigate.
It goes down, past the roots of the tree, to the murky, muddy bottom 1km below.
There is no other living thing in this water.
The water is devoid of life, and is stagnant.
It is clear.

The gang take pieces of the cauldron away so it can't be fixed.
V and Nedda trash the home of the hags, and the gang sets fire to the tree.
It goes up in flames.

The gang makes it back to the place they originally fell.
They go into the forest.
E finds a defensible and hidden place a bit north, in a thicket.
The gang rest for 14 hours, long enough for all of them to rest and for A to spend 6 hours transcribing 
Speak With Plants.
On E's watch, he sees bright and colourful points of light drifting by, but they did not bother the gang.

The next "day" (there is no night),
the gang returns to the place they originally fell.
A casts Speak With Plants and has a conversation with a tree nearby,
and learns nothing.
A then casts Detect Magic, but can't see anything interesting in the sky.
He then casts Fly, and flies up to see if there is a way back.
He sees no such way back.
But he does spot a few other large trees poking out of the fog further east into the bog, 
possible locations of other hags.

The gang decide to return to the dryads.
B, remembering that he can speak Sylvan, 
converses with them.
The dryads tell B that the gang has upset things in (done ill in? brought woe to?) their land.
They have to make good with the lizardfolk.

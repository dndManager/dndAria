# Fly, You Fools!

K and Gingruil join back up with A, E, and V.
The gang solve the puzzle of the coloured candles: light them in rainbow order.
The secret door slides down, opening into an unlit short passage, at the end of which is a large chest.
K checks for traps, and doesn't find any; unrelatedly, there are no traps.
The chest is unlocked.

The contents of the chest are an assortment of gear, all of which are magical:
- 3 potions of healing (2d4+2) [Kx2, V]
- 1 potion (with a piece of a large fingernail in it) of storm giant strength [K]
- perpetually smoking plate armour [V]
- +2 leather armour [E]
- a single unbreakable arrow [A]
- 50 walloping (DC 10 STR or prone) blowgun needles [K]
- broom of flying [A]
- scroll of Protection from Good and Evil [V]
A spends time identifying each item, while V tries to make the hole to the statue room 
look like was dug through from the other side.
At some point, Gingruil returns to his duties.

The gang hears Gingruil say "Hi Mr. V", and tell him that we were in the chamber through the hole.
Thereafter, a dragonborn in bright golden armour (like under Siridila)
started crawling through the hole.
A Magic Missiles it, and K stuns it.
As it is pulled back through the hole,
V casts Fog Cloud, and the gang run away.
They scramble up through the xvart holes, and appear on the surface.
A and E get on the broom to collect Drazda and Cray.

Before they can leave, the gang is attacked by 4 blink dogs and 3 shadow mastifs.
The battle is swift, but after some well placed punches, arrows, and a Shatter,
the gang is victorious.
The largest shadow mastif disappears and retreats.
K has some mixed feelings about punching to death a grappled and prone dog,
but he eventually comes around.
K and V stuff the dogs (back end first) into the xvart tunnel entrances.

A and E invisibly re-enter the basement, and get Drazda and Cray.
The gang come together at the base of the plateau,
and head back toward the unicorn watering hole.
They manage to get through the 8 meteor traps they encountered on their way to the plateau.
A only fell once.

The gang spends the night with the univorns, exchanging information.
The pools are now glowing under the starlight.

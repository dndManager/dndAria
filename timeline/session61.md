# Better Homes and Goblins

The gang reflect on the first two Sending spells that V cast.

V to S:
> Sevro. Vargan here. Is there anything you discovered shadowing us that we should to know?  Is there anything you need from us to help you?

> Trapped in the Shadow Place, lost my Gnoll headdress. Thought this place was a myth. Enemies approach, following your trail. Alidris can bring me back.

V to Halgruk:
> Halgruk. Vargan here. Snap out of it man. We are headed for EPIC. Meet us there. Goblins along the way. Maybe orb related. Send update.

> Soooo goood to hear from you Vasargan. Iâ€™ll bash those goblin skulllls to smithereeens. Order me another. Preferableely something strong, real strong.

They will reflect on the other four later.

The gang leave Crossroads on the south road, which is more of a trail.
A is unusually quiet; he will likely spend most of his time studying.
But he does use a raven familiar to scout.
The grass is shorter, thinner, and greener now that it is spring, only about 3' tall.
The gang have a good view of the surroundings.
E recognizes goblin and hobgoblin footprints criss-crossing the trail,
and this gets more frequent by the time they are half a day from the Crossroads.
No goblins are spotted.

The reach the area of the Stone family farm.
There are footprints everywhere.
The house is in tact.
They evacuated the livestock.
But the fences look trampled or forced down in places.
E goes into the house (the door is ajar).
Furniture is overturned, but it is structurally fine.

A reflects on the lifespan of orb-spawned creatures.
Based on the skeleton population equilibrium on the island, the frequency of spawning, and the lack of hordes of goblins everywhere, A suspects a lifetime of about 4 hours.
The gang wonder if the goblins only come out at night, given the way the orbs work.

The gang decide to visit Joe Goblinseer's farm, just south of the Stone farm.
It is, in fact, built on the farm that was ransacked by the ogres.
They take a route through the neighbouring woods to the east,
and find concentrations of goblin and hobgoblin tracks a solid path headed east or (mostly) southeast of the house.
They decide to go to Joe's farm instead of following them.
At Joe's farm, they see the house that they torched, and Joe's newer house that has also been burned down.
They see another path of goblin and hobgoblin tracks through the east woods,
this time more east than southeast.
The gang suspects that the paths converge.

They follow the path, down a hill and into the woods.
It is getting dark quickly;
the gang are tired, but they push on.
After half an hour, it is dark.
They hear howling of wolves in the distance;
old enemies, perhaps, but this time the gang has a monk with them from the start.

They hear sounds nearby, a couple hundred feet ahead.
The gang hides in the woods, and wait.
They see three goblins riding wolves.
The gang set up an ambush,
leading with the monk who drunkenly approaches them.
K punches and stuns, E shoots from his natural habitat (up a tree), 
and V launches a few into the woods with his hammer and wrath.
The gang make short work of them.

They hear more coming, so they drag into the woods the remaining bodies.
Another group of three goblins riding wolves passes by.
The gang check the goblin necks: they not quite the same tatoos as the original goblins.
These tatoos show a pool of lava at the bottom,
suggesting the orb and the spawns have powered up.

Another half an hour along the path and the gang can see a fire through the trees.
E scouts out a clearing with a camp fire.
In the clearing is a makeshift defensive position, small but fort-like,
surrounded by a 6' high palissade.
From the fort he hears voices speaking in a language he doesn't understand.
He sees a hobgoblin in the fort in chainmail, with a shield and sword nearby.
Then he spots a second inside.
there is a third by the door that the gang eventually see, but this one is in half-plate and has longer hair.

The gang set up an attack from the part of the woods to the north of the clearing.
E and V go up a tree, while K waits for an opportunity to run in.
V casts call lightning, and strikes two of them in the fort, killing one, and sending the other into a corner.
K runs in and finishes them off, saving one for interrogation.

They bind the hobgoblin, who speaks common.
E keeps watch at the door.
V intimidates the hobgoblin by eating his companion's eyes and calling down lightning.
They learn that he has detailed memories of his life, but doesn't know/understand/volunteer 
how he got there or what the tatoos are or what their purpose is.
K finishes him off.
The gang suspects that these creatures aren't created out of nothing, but are summoned from somewhere.

The gang tries to sleep in the fort, with K on first watch.
But before even an hour is up,
three new hobgoblins (equipped as before) appear, and attack.
The hobgoblin captain (?) attacks as K holds the door,
forcing the others to shoot at him with long bows. 
K runs out to draw them away,
V takes the position at the door,
E sends Boris to draw fire.
Boris goes down, but so does the captain,
and the party kills the other two as they try to retreat in opposite directions.
The party confirms that the new hobgoblins are not identical to the old ones,
which lends credence to their theory.
They loot the bodies (25cp, 47sp, 15gp), drag them into the woods,
and find a safe place in the woods to take a short rest.

Half an hour later,
they hear talking suddenly at the fort.
They also hear other talking elsewhere in the woods, consistent with goblins and wolves.
The gang decide to wait, and the goblins and wolves head away to the west/north.
The gang reason that the orb must be close, 
and A wonders if he can triangulate the location on the basis of the spawning locations.
They manage to safely take a long rest.

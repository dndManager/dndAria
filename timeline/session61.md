# Questionable Premises

V determines that E and K are still poisoned.
A returns from disposing the final body.
The gang decide that he should seek Matilda.
In the meantime,
E, K, and V take turns staying awake, so that V can manage the symptoms if the poison hurts them again,
while still getting a full rest.

A cannot find Matilda.
He seems to have just missed her at the Victorious Hamster, and so seeks her at the Cave,
since he was told she went back to the Docks.
Again, he doesn't see her.
He tries the temple, but it is empty.
He hears that she went out to the fields to smoke up, 
but when he goes out, he still can't find her, even under the full moon.
A returns, and, realizing there is nothing to be done that night,
he looks for another half hour before calling it a day.

E and K suffer no further symptoms overnight.
The next morning, V casts Lesser Restoration, and they are no longer poisoned.
E starts to clean up the mess.
K and V go out to take care of some errands:
they sell the splint (to get money for the temple) and find a 300gp diamond.
Meanwhile, when Alfgar gets to work, he and A have a discussion about his safety and his future.
He helps with the clean up.

The gang together set out to find Matilda.
They head to the Victorious Hamster, where K gets a drink,
and where they learn (from a busboy) that Matilda had been there after A left.
She stayed up late with a bunch of partiers,
nobody out of the ordinary.
She left drunk but capable.
K leads the gang to the Cave (instead of the temple),
where he gets a drink,
and the gang learns from a busboy there (who didn't party that night)
that he hasn't seen Matilda.

The gang finally go to the temple, which appears empty.
K yells for her, but there is no response.
V thaumaturgically yells for her, and she responds, hung over.
In the ensuring conversation, the gang learns:
- She thinks the assassins were retaliation for the labour organizing.
- The twitchy fighter is Jehlin Hahro, the right hand of King Nel Mourncrest.
He travels around, and is maybe here for the wedding arrangements.
- The dragonborn captain of the guard is named Venmo (!), which both answers and raises a bunch of questions.

The gang discuss the possibility of causing some more trouble, killing Hahro or Venmo, or freeing the water elementals.
But in the end, they decide to stick with the original plan and leave.
Matilda agrees to be the gang's eyes and hears in Siridila, and to find out what she can about the nefarious goings on.

The gang return home to make final arrangements before leaving.
A and Alfgar discuss his future, including perhaps leaving the business or scratching out A's name.
K makes arrangements with Siridila Suds (and maybe Enmer) to sell his brew,
and entreats Alfgar to manage the brewing.

The gang leave the walls of Siridila.
The encounter a mass of dwarves who are heading for SMC mines.
They were supposed to leave an hour ago, but not all the dwarves have gathered yet (likely because of the celebration).
The gang forge ahead.
The reach the small town south of Siridila in half a day, with the dwarves following sometime after.
V casts sending to Sevro and/or Halgruk.
The gang spend the night there.

The next day the gang sets out to the Crossroads.
When they reach the bridge over the acid canyon,
they decide to investigate.
A flies down, and notices that the canyon becomes very narrow.
The river certainly appears acidic, and comes from the swamp to the north.
V thinks that canyon itself looks natural, not acid-carved.
The gang follow the river to the source, which is a bubbling pool in the middle of swamp water.
E tests with sticks that the swamp water is fine, but the acid source and the river itself are acidic (cause the stick to sizzle).
V does a lap around the pool, and sees nothing.
There appear to be no other, prominant features.
The gang returns to the bridge.

At the Crossroads, the gang discovers the buildings are intact, and there are more people here than expected.
At the inn, they hear rumours of goblins to the south.
They find a farmer who claims his neighbour's farm was burned down, and the neighbour claimed it was by goblins.
There are a lot of panicked farmers here, but no first-hand witnesses (at first).
The gang find the Stone family, who are in town for the same reason as the other farmers.
They are fin, but they too haven't seen the goblins.
But they do introduce the gang to Joe Goblinseer,
who witnessed goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears ransack his home, burn it down, and kill his family
while he was hiding in the shed.
This was five days ago.
He wasn't able to tell if they had any markings.

That night, V again casts Sending.
The gang spend the night at the inn.

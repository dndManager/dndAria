The gang win the brawl.
V steals Halgruk's money.
The gang discover that Aria is Halgruk's wife, and that she is being held at EPIC by the army, likely led by twitchy guy.

and K along the edge.
Halgruk and friends storm in the front door, demanding Aria.
A fight breaks out against human guards, that the gang wins.
Halgruk finds Aria tied up.
Elementals appear and start to attack.
A finds Mr. V and the gang attack.
K, while on fire, climbs to Mr. V, grapples him, and jumps out of the window, bringing him to the courtyard.
He tries to escape, but the gang gangs up on him and he dies.
They retrieve a ring of spell storing.

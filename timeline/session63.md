# Spawn Point Blank (stub)

The gang explore the room and find lots of loot.
While they are investigating, a hobgoblin boss suddenly appears on the pillar's platform,
along with hobgoblins and wargs.
This catches the gang off guard.
The fight is very hard, but the gang manage to win.
They retreat to the top of the spire, to rest, wait, watch, and plan.

# Quoth the Raven

The gang learns that 5 orbs have been discovered, but only one (the blue one) has been captured.
The other four have disappeared, and none has reappeared.
Each orb spawns some creature, and each has a different colour:
 - Red (goblins?)
 - (Light) Blue (skeletons)
 - Green (animate plants)
 - Black (fiends)
 - White (?)

The gang decides to head out to Leafland.
They decide to travel north to investigate the temple of Omba on the way.
They take HF on the lake to Gateway, and then across to the salty water on the other side,
and make ground on the NE shore at a town called Larton, 
at the mouth of a river.
They leave the boat at the harbour and head for at Larton Inn for the night.
There is good Flake there.

The next day, they head north along a road for one hour, and come upon an encampment surrounded by a wooden pallisade.
The gate is open.
Inside are about 50 thatched-roof house-like stuctures,
50 huts,
and one large (70'NS, 50'EW), two-story, wooden, thatched-roof building in the middle.
Inside the main building, it is a large, two-story room with a wooden walkway along the walls about one story up.
The north wall (opposite the entrance) has 20 statues on shelves, arranged haphazardly.
There are 5 people inside, kneeling and humming, and the smell of incense.
The statues are of various gods (like Eldeth, whose symbol is a waterfall).

This is the Order of the Phoenix encampment.
The gang meets a human, Rabud Khakher, a worshipper of Lira (goddess of joy), who is here for a few weeks before leaving again for a few weeks for temple upkeep.
They learn that the temple of Omba is half a day north of the encampment.

The gang heads north along the road through the woods. 
The road turns into a path with several smaller paths branching off.
About 7 hours later, they arrive at a two-story stone structure, overgrown with plants and falling apart.
The area around the structure is an overgrown clearing in the woods.
E makes sure the area is safe.
There might be old, lightning bolt structure on the NE corner of the roof (?).
The stone is not native to this area; it's soft.
The entry is on the south, and it lacks a door.
The windows on the main floor are glass but broken.

Inside is a large room, 40' wide (E-W) and 60' long (N-S).
There are stone rafters above with ravens perched atop.
The roof is petrified wood.
The windows on the upper level are stained glass, depicting images of eyes, storms, lightning, and clouds.
At the opposite end of the room is a raised floor and a large carving on the wall.
The carving looks like a blob with wiggly lines below it:
perhaps a cloud with rain, perhaps water tumbling, perhaps an octopus.

Investigating the structure revealed nothing more.
A cast detect magic, and had a look around.
Nothing was magical except for the ravens, which transformed into imps and attacked.
Shortly thereafter, a bearded devil ran into the temple from the entrance and surprised E.
The battle was tough, and A, caught out on the front line, died.
The gang almost lost the battle, but managed to defeat the fiends.
V cast gentle repose on A's body to keep it from decaying.

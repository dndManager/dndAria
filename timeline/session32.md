# Chasing Waterfalls, or: We All Fall Down

S unlocks the door, and sneaks in.
E and V follow, while A waits back in the hallway.

There is a landing, and set of stairs up (10').
The stairs go into the corner of a large room, 100' (?) long and 60' (?) wide.
There are obsidian buttresses along the long wall in front of the stairs.
S, investigating these, hears them whispering "All must die", 
but (V determines) not in a threatening way.
In the center of the room is a large brazier, 20' across, with fire inside. 
On the wall opposite the obsidian buttresses is written: "Know me..."

On the far short wall is another set of doors, apparently the main doors, and they open into a hallway.
On the near short wall side, there is a dais, and upon it a stone altar,
and (on the side opposite the stairs) a set of stairs leading up.
E investigates the pillars,
S investigates the writing,
and V investigates the altar.
The altar has blood, channels for the blood, and a dagger.
This is clearly used for sacrifices.
V takes the dagger.

The three hear someone approach, and they hide: V and S behind the altar,
and E in the corner near the door.
A 6'5" human enters.
He is wearing bright crimson robes with gold stitching, patterned in a "V".
He is bald, and has tatoos on the side of his face.
He has two companions, both bald: on in a drab red robe, and one in blue-black robe.
The gang reveal themselves, and the man makes a speech, revealing hidden writing on the wall:

...

A battle ensues, in which the humans counterspell, and the leader summons a fire elemental.
The gang loses consciousness.

The gang are awakened by a half-elf elver named Boert, who E and S recognize from a dream.
A is with them, but doesn't wake up.
They are all on a raft, heading over a waterfall, and B decided to help save them.
Together, they manage to get the raft to the shore.

# Unseen Solution

A returns to the gang, while K goes down to roast some of the grain.
E makes sure there is no other way out of the attic.
The surviving hag is hogtied, blindfolded, and manacled.

The gang talk to the halfling girl, and discover:
- Her name is Calvyr
- She is a teenager who has spent perhaps months here doing domestic work
- She followed Valmo into a hole, and then was brought straight here with a sack on her head
- She never saw any other hags; she heard other voices sometimes
- The surviving hag is Snickering Sheri Siltbones

A casts Detect Magic, and only finds the ring (retconned as on a hag's finger) and the elixir magical.
He identifies the elixir as an Elixir of Health (equivalent of casting Lesser Restoration), which V takes.
He identifies the ring as a Ring of Mind Shielding, which he takes.
When he puts it on, he hears a voice claiming to be Silver Shirley Scrapcough, the dead hag who had the ring.
A is freaked out, and decides in the end to keep teh ring off his finger.

The gang interrogate Sheri.  They discover:
- The dead hag with the ring is indeed Shirley, and the other dead hag is Smelly Sharon Swampbaker.
She was close with Shirley, but now that she is dead, good riddance.
There is no loyalty after death.
- They did not know who the gang is.
They thought we might have been dangerous, and retreated to the attic for protection.
They were not holding the halfling hostage, they were just trying to keep her quiet.
- They got the halfing in trade from Cruel Carrie Clotteeth.
She is the only one who supplies halflings.
- They heard that Carrie's tree was burned down. She and Crinkling Clara Coldshuffler (Hagatha) survived,
but Croaking Carmen Cryptfeet died.
She doesn't know where Carrie and Clara are.
- Angela might know where Carrie is.  
Angela is an elder wise one (probably a hag), who Sheri has never seen (indeed most have never seen her;
she mostly communicates as a voice from the large central tree).
Not all hags look the same.
We can go ask Angela to contact Carrie.
- Hags live in threes to keep the peace (break ties) and to cast spells together (like the eye).
Each coven has one such eye, and it is used to protect the coven.
Hags interact when they must, but leave each other alone normally.
They used to enter the forest to find things to eat, but they stopped when they got attacked.
- Shirley lived her whole life in the Feywild.
The marsh has been here the whole time.
Perhaps Angela wouls know of a time before the marsh.
Shirley remembers a time before the fog, when she could see and enjoy the sun.
- She has not heard of Valmo or Venmo.

The gang leave K to kill Shirley in case A, E, and V don't return in 3 days.
They head to the very large central tree, maybe a thousand feet away.
No animals are spotted on the journey.
About 60' from the tree they can see it; there is less fog here.
The tree is blackened (but not from burning), knotty with protrusions, and 40' in diameter.
They circumambulate the tree at about 40' distance, but there are no visible doors or windows.
V casts Thaumaturgy, and asks for an audience with Angela.
They hear a voice, Angela, which asks what they want.
The gang enter into a negotiation:
they want all the halflings, and a commitment that the hags won't enter the prime material plane,
and knowledge of how to get home.
Angela is reluctant to give up the halflings easily, since they are excellent domestic servants.

In a flash of insight, A realizes that he can teach Angela the spell Unseen Servant, 
which is better than four halfling slaves.
Angela is intrigued.
A door appears, Angela can be seen.
She is a 6' tall woman-like creature, with sharp teeth and long claws, and black dredded hair.
Two of the dred locks (on either side of her face) are woven with cloth, and skulls hang from them.
Her somewhat tattered robe is belted with cord, and skulls hang from it as well.
She invites the gang in, but they politely decline, and negotiate outdoors.
After some discussion, Angela agrees to the gang's terms.
She summons Carrie from the large tree (Carrie has white hair);
Carrie is clearly an inferior hag.
She whistles, and the four halfling servants come out,
and she offers them to us as an act of good faith.
A gives her the ring to hold, as a reciprocal act of good faith.

Carrie is sent to collect all the remaining 6 halflings (under some threat),
while A starts to teach Angela the spell.
Before the transaction is finished,
Angela explains how to get to the prime material plane
(just as Drazda did; she suspects that Drazda just wasn't powerful enough to do it without having her power drained).
A gives Angela the ring as a token of appreciation; he is happy to be rid of it.
The gang take their leave.

The gang take Carrie to Shirley's tree (with the dead bodies) 
to intimidate and to convince her not to return to the prime material plane.
They read between the lines: she is Valmo, and was likely an elf that became a hag.
She wrote the play.

The gang (including K now) return to the grasslands, and eventually the forest.
The lizardfolk welcome them, and a celebration is held.
Drazda already had some lizardfolk collect the herbs required for the return ritual.
E offers 5 applications of essence of aether as a gift to Kiuz.

The next day, the gang and all the halflings go to the stone platform.
A performs the ritual and manages to get them all safely back to Leafland.
It is now spring; months have passed in the prime material plane since the gang has been gone.

The leader of Leafland, Taevon, is thrilled that one of their own, E, saved their people and way of life.
There is a great feast at the Tree of Life in honour of E.
He gives an extended speech through am amplifying horn,
telling tales of E's heroism.
As a gift, he gives E a minibow: the bow of the legendary halfling Areon Bowslinger.
(This is a minibow with shortbow statistics.
It has a green, interlaced, viny motif.
The bow is a magical item that requires attunement.
It has 5 charges, recharging 1d4 charges at dawn.
By expending one charge, 1d6 acid or poison damage can be added to an attack.)

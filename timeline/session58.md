# Strike

V has recruited an old dwarf, Primus, to help with reconstruction of the Mystra temple.
Primus speaks some dwarvish, and will teach it along with literacy to the population.
Matilda, Primus and V are setting up the temple when they are joined by A, E, and K.

A donates the statue of Ogma (from the ruined keep) to the temple.
He then asks Matilda if she has the EPIC spellbook.
She does, and she lends it to A.
Finally, A explains the situation with the exploited dwarven workers to V.
The gang decide on a plan:
they will collect Emner and Alfgar, and march to the dwarves to demonstrate their exploitation,
and convince them to take collective action to fix it.
V takes the contracts.

The gang go to the Victorious Hamster and get Emner's help.
Alfgar comes along, but is a bit reluctant to take part.
They all go to the gates of the city in the second quarter.

Looking across the plain, they see five large groups of workers assembling, about 150' from the walls.
On the right are the SMC-bound dwarves.
To their left, the tree-hewing dwarves.
Then a mix of dwarves and humans.
Then an unknown group.
Leftmost is the group going north.
There are more people assembled than the gang were expecting, 
probably 50 or more in each group.
Beyond the groups, which the gang is barely able to make out, are two tables (about 300' from the walls) where contracts are signed.
At each of three gates (docks, second quarter, third quarter?) are four human guards,
two on each side of the gate.
It is windy and rainy; there is a storm coming.

K merges into the logging group.
He sees that the tables are manned, and signals this to the rest of the gang.
He sees a healthly line of dwarves and humans at the two tables, signing contracts.
He begins asking for Stumpy, claiming he has a message for him.
(Stumpy is one of the dwarves whose contracts V has, and which says he will be paid 500 copper.)
Nobody responds, so he moves on to the SMC dwarves.

A makes casual conversation with the guards, and then wanders nearer to a table.
He sees that there are stacks of contracts, and makes plans to collect some.
E positions himself to steal some contracts.

K finds Stumpy in the SMC group, and leads him to the side of the group closer to the logging group.
He signals V.
V and Emner wander into the area between the groups.
V gets on his soap box, casts Thaumaturgy to make his voice louder, and gives a speech about 
exploitation, solidarity, Billy the Dwarf, clans, and storms.
He pulls out the contract for proof, and calls on Stumpy to confirm what he thought was on the contract.
He then calls on audience members who can read to confirm that the contract is different.

By this point, two curious guards have wandered over.
They stand in front of V, and grab the contract.
V casts Thaumaturgy again to make his eyes glow.
K, with great deftness, grabs the contract from the guard and speeds it to a dwarf who said he could read.
The crowd is getting agitated.
The guards don't stop K, but move toward him.
The crowd blocks the guards, and they don't press further.

The dwarf reads the contract out loud, convincing the crowd of the scam.
Another dwarf confirms it.
The crowd gets riled up.
V convinced them that collective action is the way to solve the problem,
and leads the two groups of dwarves on a march to the table.

The human manning the table tries to escape before the crowd reaches him.
V casts Call Lightning and strikes lightning down in the path of the human.
V has a vision of the storm lord.
Moreover, along the path of the lightning, a metal object falls out of the sky and embeds itself into the ground.
A moves to keep an eye on the object, and convince the man to stay.
The human panics and continues to try to escape,
but V sends down another lightning bolt in his path.
A escorts the human back to the table.

Surrounded by the crown, V gets the man to confess the entire scam.
He agrees to correct the contracts so the dwarves get the correct pay.
He also agrees to amend the contract so that the families of dwarves who are injured or die
get paid.
V evangelizes, and then goes to the metal object. 

The item is a warhammer.  He picks it up, and discovers:
- It has decorations of the storm lord (the head has clouds, the handle has a lightning bolt).
- It is warhammer/warpick hybrid weapon, so that the wielder can choose bludgeoning or piercing damage.
- It does 1d10 extra damage: an odd roll is lightning damage, an even roll is thunder damage.
- It gives advantage to skill checks involving excavating.

A chats with the various guards, and get them to agree that the scam was unfair.

E wanders over to the human/dwarf group and tells them that even the humans are being scammed as well.
The third group joins the crown, but the humans push their way to the front.
With an intimidating lecture about solidarity,
V convinces them to join the line like everyone else.

With the larger crowd, the human manning the table is afraid he will not have time to take care of everything.
He is running out of contracts, and
the human manning the second table escaped with the contracts of the humans and the remaining two groups (?).
He confesses:
- Thio is responsible for the scam.
- Jelamud, who has a room in the castle, is the person who ordered the human to do it.

A comes up with a plan.
He sends Alfgar to fetch some paper.
Those humans who can read and write
will draft contracts based on the sample contracts available.
Everyone agrees that they will reassemble at sunrise with contracts fixed, ready to work.

K leads a procession of dwarves to the Victorious Hamster for celebrations.
The party spills out into the town square.
Emner safe-keeps the contracts.
A introduces Matilda to various citizens who might be helpful or useful.

# Breaking Ground; or: The Element of Surprise

The gang return to the lava room.
They go through the iron door.
The door opens into a passage.
Right on the other side of the door, A finds another, smaller Thunderstone mine, which he disarms so the gang can use it.
The passage has a dead end, with a stone door to the side about midway down.
The gang pass through the stone door, which is open.

They enter a large room whose floor gently slopes to one side.
At the bottom of the room is a brownish, watery liquid, probably mud.
At the top of the room is the stone door that the gang were unable to pass before.
The gang suspect mud mephits.
E produces Kneal, who squeezes his way to the egde of the mud.
The gang prepare for another big fight.
After K confirms that there is a mud mephit in the mud,
A nukes the mud with a fireball.
It turns out to be overkill, since there were only two mephits.

The gang are able to open the impassable stone door from the inside of the room.
They investigate the teleportation trap on the other side, but gain no more information.
The gang completes the investigation of the basement,
discovering two secret passages and another room connected to the wooden doors of the lava room,
and take a 30 minute rest.

They decide to go down to the sub-basement.
On their way, they burn the study, hoping to obscure their passage and theft of the book.

The stairs to the sub-basement spiral down (square-wise, 15'x15'), spiraling 3 times.
At the foot of the stairs is an iron portcullis
connected to a winch.
The portcullis seems light enough to lift if necessary, and E can both squeeze through the bars
and operate the winch.
E opens the portcullis, and A jams a stone into it to keep the portcullis open.
The gang pass through.

The gang enter a very large room.
The room appears to have had a granite floor, 
but the floor has been pulled up everywhere except for a 5' border along the walls.
There are piles of granite (presumably the pulled up floor) at the corners.
Near one corner is a bubbling pool of what looks like mud.
The rest of the floor is open earth.
There is a wooden door with a barred window at the far end,
and a another such door at the near end.

A casually strolls across the bare earth to the mud pit, while E walks along the earth to a nearby corner.
A hears a rumbling under the mud, and retreats back near E,
who summons a wolf and sends it to the edge of the mud.
Suddenly,
two earth elementals appear out of the earth right in front of A and E, and begin viciously attacking them.
K runs to attack them, stunning one.
V shatters them, which seems to be extra effective.
A casts Fireball, which also hurts the wolf.
Sadly, the name Bernie is taken.
E attempts to attack them, but it is mostly fruitless at close range.
E falls to an elemental.

K continues his attacks, but can't stun them.
V continues to cast Shatter, with less damage.
A attempts to escape, and goes back to the portcullis.
E is closer to dying.
One elementals starts to attack K.
The other chases after A but, after being blocked by the pile of granite,
attacks V instead.
K attacks again,
and V ends the battle with a third and even weaker casting of Shatter.
V heals E, and the gang take a short rest back by the stairs.

The gang recover some money from the room.
The far door opens into a dark passage with an impassable cave-in.
The near door opens to a passage with some light, 
but the light dimishes around a corner.
There is a wooden bookcase at the end of the passage.
There is a small hole in this bookcase, with light spilling out;
the bookcase is a secret door.
They hear on the other side dwarves, arguing over who will marry some particular person,
which seems to end in a sword fight.

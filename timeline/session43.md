# Up In Smoke (or: Smoke Gets In Your Eyes)

The gang investigate the chimney of the fireplace.
It's about 2' in width.
There is no light coming through.
It doesn't go straight up (it's slanted).
E climbs up,
and discovers that it winds around, and eventually exits onto the plateau into the twighlight.
The narrowest point is just below the surface.
E can't see Drazda and Cray; he calls out for them, and then sees them.
He returns to the room.

The gang continues to investigate the room.
A finds a face carved into a wall,
and nearby there is a stone that looks like it can be pushed.
He pushes it, and it reveals a false wall that slides to the left.
Behind it is another wall with a handle on it.
V goes back to the centipede room,
and notices the same face, stone, and false wall opposite this one;
it is a secret passage connecting them.

The fireplace room has a stone door on one wall and a reinforced wooden door on another.
The gang notices smoke from the stone door, but the door isn't hot.
The door is, however, trapped:
there are small holes that emit a noxious gas (unconnected to the smoke).
The door has a latch on this side, and opens out.
V opens the latch and pushes the door open forcefully.

On the other side, there is light smoke throughout the room.
The opening of the door moves air enough to reveal
a small (~1') creature flying in the middle of the room,
with a long skinny nose, all black, bat-like wings, with angular/chipped features,
generating smoke.
There are, in fact, many more of these creatures in the room,
at least five.
A thinks they are some sort of elemental, and probably evil.
He fireballs the room, to no effect.

The gang try to hold their room, rather than entering the other room.
E closes the door, and the gang waits.
The creatures (maybe 7 in total) manage to open the door, 
and blast the gang with ash, so as to blind B and V,
and put out the lights.
B puts a cloud of daggers at the bottleneck,
where V puts a spiritual weapon.
E produces a giant elk from the Bag of Tricks,
who is christened Neil, since it has to kneel to fit in the space.
A pulls out his bow.
When a creature dies, it goes up in a puff of smoke.
The fight ends when V passes through the cloud of daggers and Thunderwaves them,
causing a loud sound.

The new room has walls contructed out of granite, in a cobblestone manner.
It has three doors:
a stone door and a nice wooden door on one wall, and a stone door on another.
There is a crumbling battleaxe in one corner, 
and a well in another.
There are tiny holes in the floor, from which tiny amounts of smoke are rising.

Before trying another door, the gang get a funny feeling that they are being watched
by some presence in the room.
So they decide to break the well.
The well has potable water, and the water level is above the floor level.
V takes the crumbling axe and starts to chip away at the well wall,
with the help of B and E.
Suddenly, something invisible tries to grab B.
It eventually succeeds, and drags B into the well,
around a U-bend,
and out the side of the plateau (cliff face).
It tries to fly away with B.
The rest of the gang follow through the well,
and get to the cliff face.
The creature says "Baerfar" to B.
A casts Fly on himself.

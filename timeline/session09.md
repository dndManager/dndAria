# I Know What You Did Last Summer

The gang breaks for the summer.
A returns to the town where he has his cartography business, but things don't go well, and he loses money.
E returns to the area around Leafland, looking for clues as to the whereabouts of the missing children.
S stays at EPIC in secret, finding a secret passage way and making friends with Roke, another rogue who is secretly staying at EPIC.
V finishes his shrine (which now has a continual flame), does masonry work, and wanders the surrounding area looking for temples.

When they return, Halgruk sends them on a mission to investigate a mysterious island that arose in the lake about a month earlier.
They take the rowboat, christened Henrik's Folly, and head off first thing in the morning.
They arrive at the island at sunset from the west (?).

The island is rocky with no vegetation, about 600yd in diameter.
It has a spire in the middle; essentially a pile of boulders 100yd tall and >100yd wide at the base.
The entire island is made of a greyish, porous stone, probably basalt.
There is some greenish moss in places, which is strange given how long the island has existed.
The gang finds a place to beach HF, where there are some other boats, near a 10'x10' rough cave entrance.

The cave is long, many 100s of yards, and goes from a rough interior to a smooth one.
It's not long before they come upon some bodies, unarmoured dwarves (?) with arrows in their backs.
The gang suspects a trap.
S tries to figure out how to proceed.
A decides to walk up to the bodies and trigger the trap, and is hit by arrows from the ceiling.
Using V's shield, the gang figure out that there are coupled holes in the ceiling and floor, and breaking line of sight between them triggers the trap.
They figure out a way around the trap.

They encounter a fork in the tunnel: one passage 45&deg; to the left, one passage straight, and one passage 45&deg; to the right.
There is a loud clanging sound.
S takes scouts out the left passage, triggers a trapdoor, and tumbles to the level below (where there is a passage parallel to the one above).
The gang are attacked by three (?) skeletons, one from each passage.
The skeletons are an unusal, glowing green colour.
The gang fights the skeletons; A falls but E brings him back up, and evenually the gang wins.

The gang discovers that the skeletons have a symbol on the back of their skulls: a bluish triple integral symbol.

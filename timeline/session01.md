# An EPIC Beginning

After being invited to the EPIC adventuring school via a letter

> Recruit,
>
> You are invited to join EPIC. Arrive at The Gateway Inn by sundown on 9th of Yaxk'in. Leave your supplies; all will be provided.
>
> To the first go the riches,	
> 	
> Halgruk Threnriredr	

the gang arrive individually (around sundown on the 9th of Yaxkin (?)) at the Gateway Inn.
The innkeeper, [Hulda](../people/hulda.html), gives each a key to a room.
Two members, E and V, investigate the area and find boats.
There is a reunion of sorts at dinner, where the 2nd years who were away for the summer feast.

The next day, the 2nd years row everyone to EPIC headquarters.
V replaces [Alark](../people/alark.md) at an oar.
The 2nd years begin to sing [an old dwarven tune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ymgFyzbDo) 
(or [a shorter version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pyy_FIYE7EE)), 
with an additional verse:  

> To our lost, companions true,
>
> We will strive, to bring you home.
>
> Aria, captive of Pharas,
>
> We will rescue you and make him pay.  

Arriving at EPIC, the all are welcomed by [Halgruk](../people/halgruk.html), 
who states two rules: no weapons and no fighting.
They learn about the armoury and the vaults near the armoury.
There are no dedicated temples or shrines.

Some time later, the gang are pitted against a fighter, cleric, wizard, and thief in sport-like battle.
The gola is to get an item from the middle of the arena to the opposing side.
A takes out the wizard, E engages the remainder, V obscures the area with a fog cloud, and S finds and removes the item from its container.
V carries to the item across to the opposing side, to boos from the crowd.

The gang wakes up in a forest without their gear, with a note:  

> *Find your way home.*
> -- *Halgruk*

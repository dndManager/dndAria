V tries to convince the dwaves in the modest district that they need to start 
worshipping the storm lord Umbo. 
He tells them a storm is coming and it will wash away the evils of this world.
He mentions that dwarves are not supposed to be subservient to humans, 
but that when they lived in mountains, they had powerful clans. 
The dwarves seem to have no recognition of these events.

A let V know that he regularly attends the Temple of Mystra in the poor district.
V asks if A ever noticed the symbolism with the star being broken when the door 
is open. 
A mentions he never noticed this and V smiles smugly at that. 

Alfgar's immediate family is in the comfortable district, but he frequents the 
modest district to visit cousin. 



In The Cave, S walks right up to the barkeep and orders 4 beers at 1 cp per. 
While they are drinking their beers, 
the team sees a noble in plain clothes but walking upright walk out of the bar
and later return with a whore from next door. 
The team tries to follow him down the hall but find a locked stone door.
Stanvig Doorwatcher, the local constable, follows the team down a tunnel at the back
of the bar.
This tunnel leads to a number of nooks and crannies one of which is a bathroom
and others have bar supplies, e.g. barrels of beer and crates of salted foods.

E tries to find where the noble went but only finds the bathroom. 
V reminds him that E could have just followed the nobles tracks. 
V follows the tracks of the noble back and notice they lead into one of the nooks 
and the footsteps go under a stone door.
The team non-chalantly head down the tunnel where the find the stone door is 
locked.

A human captain, named Stanvig Doorwatcher, with two lieutenants shows up as the 
team is trying to determine how to open the door. 
He asks the team if he can help them.
Alidris slinks by him to use the bathroom and then heads back to the bar. 
Erich uses the bag of tricks and tries to hide the boar that results behind him.
Then he says "We should all run" which resulted in the boar heading back to the 
bar and the two lieutenants following it. 
The boar proceeds to trash the bar as patrons attempt (unsuccessfully) to
subdue it...all while Alidris watches.
Eventually the lieutenants kill it.

Sevro charms the captain who eventually buys (without paying for it) the team
a beer.
Feeling ashamed for Stanvig's lack of payment, Alidris pays for the beers. 
Erich tries to get Stanvig drunk, but he appears to have a high tolerance and 
a slow pace for drinking beer. 
Sevro suggests Stanvig take the night off and the team will watch the door for 
him.
After paying Stanvig 3 sp, he agrees. 

Erich and Vargan head to the brothel to collect intel where they pay a 
prostitute 2 sp and 4 cp. 
The prostitute says that she doesn't know of any colleagues going missing and 
that the nobles take prostitutes through the tunnel because the rooms are 
nicer there.
She likes going up there because they have free wine. 

Sevro and Alidris see another noble walk out of the bar and Vargan sees them 
enter the brothel and head to the back with only a nod to the brothelkeep.

# Lavatory of the Cave

S reveals that he knows a guy (as only he can) who gave him a tip on sneaking onto the castle in the wealthy quarter.
S leads the gang through the poor quarter 
(which is mostly peopled by humans;
dwarves dominate the modest quarter, while the other quarters are more mixed).
S leads the gang to "The Cave", 
a tavern inset into the cliff dividing the poor and wealth quarters.
The Cave is beside a brothel, also inset into the cliff, called "The Hairy Cave".
The Cave is actually an unfinshed cave; it is boisterous with haphazardly placed furniture,
and has a big (but not strong), hideous, and rude barkeep.
There are about 30 people there, with a capacity of 50.

There is one human out of place;
he looks well-off but isn't dressed well-off,
and walks into the tavern from the back,
He leaves the tavern.
E checks out the back.
This foul part of the cave includes nooks used as a toilets.
But E sees footprints that disappear into a wall past the toilets.

The human returns to the tavern with a woman,
and they go back.
S follows them, and sees that they pass through a hidden door.
The gang follows, but they can't get the door open.
They are confronted by three out-of-place humans who are apparently acting like a police force, but also look like bandits.
A and V walk toward the tavern, pretending to use the toilets.
E releases Boris the boar, and two "bandits" are startled, and follow it into the bar to kill it.
S charms the remaining one, Stanvig Doorwatcher, who is the leader.
Stanvig takes us back to the tavern and gets the gang drinks from the bar.
(He did not pay for them; in disgust, A pays for them.)
He describes the door as one-way that locks from the other side.
He is in charge of watching the door, but leaves this job to the gang, and goes home.
(When Charm wears off, he returns, but laughs at the gang's antics.)

E and V, concerned that nobles might be taking prostitutes to be sacrificed,
go to the brothel for intel.
They discover that there is no known human sacrifice of prostitutes.

A notices a human walk out from the back and out the tavern.

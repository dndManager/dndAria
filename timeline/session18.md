# Unfinished Business

While A recovers from being raised, E, S, and V decide to visit Hama and kill some harpies.
They take HF there, and almost get caught by an SMC dwarf with a boat.
When they get to Hama, they see he has made progress on his house (the porch, the garden).
V helps out by making repairs.
E helps out by killing a badger living under the house.
S "helps out" by stealing some things.
They spend the night there, but Hama will not help with the harpies.

The next day, the gang sets out to attack the harpies.
After an extended battle with three harpies in series, they ascend a central spire to kill the last one.
They loot the nests for treasure and head back to EPIC.

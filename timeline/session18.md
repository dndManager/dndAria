# Unfinished Business

While A recovers from being raised, E, S, and V decide to visit Hama and kill some harpies.
They take HF there, and almost get caught by an SMC dwarf with a boat.
When they get to Hama, they see he has made progress on his house (the porch, the garden).
V helps out by making repairs.
E helps out by killing a badger living under the house.
S "helps out" by stealing some things.
They spend the night there, but Hama will not help with the harpies.

The next day, on the way to the harpies, the gang hear some rustling.
E sends out a panther from the bag of tricks to investigate, and it kills one giant wasp.
The gang kills two others.

The gang arrives at a rugged and rough area with multiple harpy nests.
After an extended battle with three harpies in series, they ascend a central spire to kill the last one.
They loot the nests for treasure (15ep, 5pp, some gold?, and 4x25gp eggs) and head back to EPIC.

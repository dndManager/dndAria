# You Can't Go Home Again

E's bow: 7 charges, recharges 1d6+1 at dawn, he has to expend the charge before making the attack.

While at the Tree of Life, K looks north over Leafland and sees the mountains.
He recognizes them: they are his home, though he remembers Leafland's area as a swamp.
In conversations with E and A, he learns:
- Leafland has been around at least for several halfling generations, for as long as people can remember.
- It suddenly appeared in A's grandfather's lifetime, which is why he went to map it.
The gang speculate that it came into being as a leak from the Feywild, 
or that the Hag bog and Leafland swapped places centuries ago.
E remarks that there were witches in the swamp.

V casts Sending to contact S.
He gets no response, and assumes he has passed.
E holds out hope.
V casts Sending to contact Matilda.
In slurred speech, Matilda says that EPIC is destroyed, she is at the cave, and the gang should save themselves.
The gang reason that she is at The Cave in Siridila.

The next day, Taevon gathers the gang to give them grave news.
- He has learned the news from Bolveg, the messenger for the Duquevial Dynasty,
who the gang helped guide through Leafland when they first arrived.
(V is familiar with the dynasty, since they have territory on the eastern coast.)
Bolveg had been relaying messages between the Lord of Siridila and the head of the dynasty,
since the former wanted to arrange a marriage between his son with the latter's daughter.
Every time he passed through, Bolveg would give news.
- Monsters have been appearing, and laying waste to towns.
There are dragons destroying the north.
The Crossroads have been destroyed.
Siridila has been spared so far.
- K asks about the dwarves of the northern mountains.
Taevon replies that he knows of no dwarves there.
- A asks about his forest homeland to the northwest.
Taevon has no news.

The gang decide to leave for Siridila.
The navigate through Leafland and to the green wall.
They see a steady stream of people heading south;
mostly human (and some dwarven) refugees, carrying whatever they can.
The gang join a group of them.
E makes conversation with a man, and discovers:
- They are from the town of Sterridge (?). 
- The area north of it has been overrun by dragons (which they have not personally seen).
- Everyone is fleeing; they don't really know where they are going.
- He is a baker, looking to set up shop somewhere new.
A tells the man that Siridila is south along the road.
K buys half of his yeast for 1gp.
V tries to convert him.

V casts Sending, again to Matilda.
He learns that EPIC fell to council infighting, the orb is lost, and she will save a pint for us.
For E's sake, V casts Sending again to contact Sevro.
In response, Sevro says he is right behind them;
V sees shuffling in the dust as of foot falls.
The gang aren't sure what is going on,
but they fill K in on it.
K and his hat are more interested in getting to the destination.

When they get to the nearest town,
E goes to retreive Ferris,
and takes him to the tavern.
There is a joyful reunion between Ferris and the gang, 
though K again doesn't understand.
They enter the tavern,
which is crawling with people.

The tavern keeper tells the gang that 
there are no mugs left.
He pours beer into K's and V's waterskins.
In conversation with him, the gang learn:
- The tavern has been hectic for a few weeks.
- There have been no monsters around here.
- Not many are traveling north along the road these days.
- Everybody is heading to Siridila.
- He crafts his own crappy-tasting beer.
K tries to start a brewing business with him:
100gp (and half the profit) for half the grain.
The tavern keeper declines.
The gang finish their drinks, and go to the outskirts of town to camp for the night.

The next day, the gang join the stream of refugees to Siridila.
They encounter a guard station on the road; it was not present the last time there were here.
The guard organizes them into three lines:
- To his left: those with papers.
- To his right: dwarves without papers.
- In the middle: everyone else.
The gang get a bad feeling about this.
There is a camp some way behind the station, outside of Siridila.
The middle line goes there.
The dwarf line arcs around it.

When the gang apprach the guard,
it's clear to him that they are not refugees.
A has some items that indicate that he is a resident of Siridila, and so the gang go to the first line.
V has a quick conversation with a dwarf in the dwarf line about overthrowing human institutions and the Storm Lord.
The gang see checkpoints between the camp and the city gates, which they bypass.
At the gates, they see two signs of note.

The first:
> Silver mine looking for dwarves, but might accept anyone.

This is likely Henrik's SMC.
V vandalizes the sign, scrawling "Remember Billy the Dwarf" on it.

The second:
> The Lord of Siridila will say a few words tomorrow at noon in the second quarter of the city.

The gang return to A's shop.
Alfgar is not there,
but it looks like he has been working hard.
A retrieves 90gp.

At K's insistence, the gang leave for the Cave.
K is alarmingly good at finding the quickest route there, 
surprising even E and A with his route.
They find Matilda at the bar.
E strikes up a conversation, and talks her ear off about the adventure.
She tells the gang:
- EPIC fell apart.
- There was a disagreement at the council that led to blows and bloodshed.
- Someone took the orb.
At that point, she passed out, so she was unable to give the details.
They find out that she talks to nobody, and has been sleeping at the bar.

As they drink, V notices a noble leaving the lavatory area and entering the bar, heading for the door.
He nudges K, pointing him out.
K interprets this as an invitaton to attack.
He sneaks up and punches him from behind, stunning him.
He quickly puts his arm around him as if he saved him, and guides him out of the bar.
The gang follow.
Thereafter followed an awkward conversation,
wherein the gang learn that the noble is named Thio,
and E introduces A to him.
Thio has heard some rumours that the death temple sacrifices both animals and people;
V tries to get him to avoid the temple, and instead worship Umbo.
Thio returns to the bar.

The gang take Matilda back to A's shop.
A and K make arrangements to brew some beer.
The gang rest for the night.

The next day, while Matilda is still sleeping,
the gang go to hear the lord's speech inconspicuously.
There is a recently constructed platform there.
On a raised dais stands the lord, Rath Waterless.
Behind him is his family, including Thio.
On his right is the dragonborn, in his shiny armour, with some guards.
On his left is Mr V, along with some wizards of the temple.

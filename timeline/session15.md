# Many Meetings

A falls ill.  E, S, and V have to manage without him.

The gang spots Halgruk re-entering EPIC, bloodied and stumbling.
They notice a trickle of elves and humans (and one or two dwarves), 12 in all, arriving at EPIC with seeming purpose.
Some big meeting is evidently happening.

While V is working on crafting some runestones, a messenger arrives with a note for him.
The note, signed Zaben, says they have information about the temples of Grakas, and that they will be at the air temple there.

The gang tries to learn about what is going on with the meeting, which seems to be taking place in Matilda's quarters.
They fail at distracting the guards long enough to sneak S into the room,
but V does get three passes to Grakas from Halgruk.
On their way out,
they spot another human coming for the meeing.
S charms him and gets information from him.
He is Fagram Mirsk, ruler of the kingdom of Mirsk.
There are glowing orbs appearing all over the place.
The arrivals are part of a meeting of the great and the good, to figure out how to deal with the issue.
Fargram Mirsk realizes that he's been charmed, but is amused by it.

The gang take Henrik's Folly to Grakas.
E and S go to the seedy pub, The Lyrical Rat's Pub, for lunch and information.
The bartender is Ommummri.

V goes to meet Zaben at the air temple.
Zaben informs V:
The temples of Grakas are empty because the townfolk are losing faith.
He and his friends are dedicated to the upkeep of disused temples.
There is a prophecy that the gods will get angry when people lose faith,
and they will come down en masse to rectify the situation.
Their purpose, whether to reconvert or to destroy, is unclear.

Zaben (human) is from the Order of the Phoenix,
whose camp is one day north.
The order was formed a few centuries ago, during a renaissance of faith.
Zaben comes to Grakas twice a year for temple upkeep (both air and fire).
This particular temple, the Temple of Aeolus, is the only such temple in the kingdom.
Grakas is not old (only about 100 years), 
so the temples are not yet in serious disrepair.
There is an abandoned temple of Omba, the god of thunder, 1.5 days north.

V also arranges for a pair of 50gp platinum rings to be made.
They will be ready in a few days.

V meets E and S at the pub.
They have not gained any information.
V sits with some dwarves (employees of SMC) who seem to be grieving, and buys them a drink.
He learns that Billy the Dwarf fell to his death mysteriously.
He tries to convince them that humans build institutions because of their short lives,
but those institutions help them dominate.
The dwarves should consider seizing the means of production,
lest they continue to be exploited.
There is something about a secret boulder.

The gang returns to EPIC.

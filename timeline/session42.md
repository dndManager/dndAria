# Basement Dwellers

The gang arrive at the opal plateau about 4 hours after leaving the watering hole.
It is about 60'-80' high, and 100' long.
The hailstorms, which started when the were an hour away from the plateau, stopped as they approached the plateau
(Drazda knows nothing of these.)
The unicorns veer left, to get around to the side of the plateau that has a lower slope.
They won't travel up this ramp, since they don't like how the rocky ground feels on their hooves.
The gang say goodbye to their unicorns:
- Twighlight Sparkle (A)
- Jimmy Hoofa (B)
- Shimmer (E)
- Thunderhoof (V -- gives Guidance)

The gang walk up the ramp, which spirals up to the top of the plateau.
It seems to be cut out of the stone itself, which is flaggy.
It is like rough-hewn steps, clearly man-made.
On the way, they see the forest to the southwest, a forest to the north, and the foggy bog to the east.
The sun will soon be setting (in the north).

The top of the plateau is unusually smooth opal.
When the gang get to the top, they see Illitheria's wooden house, but it has been burnt down, especially the right side.
There is no smoke, so this is not recent.
This is not normal, according to Drazda.
After some investigation, they find a burnt chair and desk and a burned, tattered rug.
There is a trap door in the centre of the room, under a part of a rug that wasn't burned,
with some stairs leading underground.
Drazda and Cray stay above.
Drazda tells the players to tell Illitheria:
> Drazda sent you. You are interested in learning about planar travel. She taught me 4 suns ago.

The gang also want to tell her that Drazda is ill.

The gang head underground.
At the bottom of the stairs, they find a narrow dungeon carved out of the stone, with magical lighting.
They encounter an unlocked granite door trapped with a swinging blade.
Despite knowing about it, E sets the trap off, and gets injured.
V hammers a piton into the blade slit, and A pushes through the door.

On the other side is a room with an iron door, a stone door, and a wooden door.
E produces Boris, who runs around the room, ensuring it is not trapped.

The iron door is locked, but A manages to use his spider familiar and mage hand to open it from the other side.
It opens into a corridor where the gang encounter a purple blob.
The gang retreats into the room, but B thought it was a good idea to stay in the corridor.
The party dispatches the creature, with B delivering the killing blow.
But B is injured by it.

The corridor forks, and down one fork there is a wooden door reinforced with iron, 
and a stone door.
A opens the wooden door as before, but this triggers a rock trap, 
which all but B manage to avoid.
A opens the the door and sees two giant centipedes.
V pulls him out of the doorway and stands in it.
B zaps both centipedes, killing them.
This room seems to be a dead end, so the gang take a short rest there.
A and V eat some centipedes, while B takes a nap.
There is 13g and 14s here.

Afterwards, A opens the other stone door.
V hears breathing to the side, so he steps in.
Inside is a gangly one-eyed creature with a spiky back.
It tries to do something to V with its gaze, but he shakes it off.
The gang charges in, with B taking some damage.
The gang overcome the foe, and V takes the eye to eat.

The room has a pair of doors and a fireplace.

# Dexter a Lion Or, Sinister a Unicorn Argent

The next day, the gang assemble with Drazda and a scout, Cray.
Cray has the following stats:
> AC 15  
> HP 33  
> 2 melee attacks: bite, club, javelin (thrown 30/120), shield  
> Each attack is at +4 and does 1d6+2 damage

Drazda tells them that the opal-ish plateau of Illitheria is to the northwest,
is 60'-100' tall,
and is topped by a castle.
Cray knows the way.
For the journey,
A regularly casts Tenser's Floating Disk to carry Drazda.
She weighs ~200lbs, so there is room for another on the disk.

The gang leave the lizardfolk encampment and head north,
passing through the beautiful and lush forested area,
in the same direction as the eel river.
The waters here flow right to left (east to west).
After 6 hours of travel,
they arrive at the edge of the forest.

Before them is an undulating landscape of grassland, with 6' tall golden grass.
The tree tops and grasses are blown by a strong wind from the east;
not normal, but not unheard of.
The grassland has paths winding throughout it, 
more like game trails than roads,
15'-20' wide.
It is chilly.

Cray pauses at the edge.
The gang notices dozens of tiny (6"-12") winged creatures standing in branches and hovering in the air.
They are mostly facing the grasslands, but some are looking upon the the gang,
though not in a menacing way.
They are armed with bows.
E approaches, and B joins him in case they don't speak common.
E strikes up a conversation with two of them (Daysi and Nyasa),
wherein he learns:
- they know of Illitheria, and where she is (they point to the northwest)
- they guard the forest from evil doers and mischief makers from the grasslands
- they pepper hags with poisoned arrows to get them to sleep, and then take them away from the forest
- they trust us because we are with lizardfolk

E trades 2 cockatrice claws and a cockatrice egg for 2 bags of the poison.
The poison, Essence of Ether, is a paste that is applied to arrows.
Each bag has 5 applications.
> _Essence of Ether_  
> A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. 
> The poisoned creature is unconscious. 
> The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

The gang are led into the grasslands, along the paths.
B stands on the disk so he can see.
After about 1 hour,
they hear a herd of horses traveling from left to right.
Soon it becomes clear that these are not horses, they are unicorns,
brilliant white with metallic gold horns.
Eventually, they see 9 such unicorns traveling in a herd.
Seeking to make contact, A teaches V the elvish word for "Hello",
and V casts thaumaturgy to yell it as loud as he can.
The unicorns curve toward the gang.
The unicorns beging speaking in Elvish, Sylvan, and Celestial,
telling those who understand: "Run! Behind us!" (not: "Run behind us!").
They continue to approach, and repeat the warning telepathically.
B sees, about 1000' away, lions.

B asks very charismatically whether they can give the gang a lift.
They agree.
Cray freaks out, and runs back to the forest.
The gang head north, riding unicorns, with Drazda being dragged behind.
The unicorns leap a small ravine, but it knocks Drazda off the disk, and she tumbles to the ground.
B, E, and V stop; V dismounts and attends to her.

Meanwhile, A consults the unicorn he rides and hatches a plan,
which he probably called "Death From Above".
He casts Fly on the unicorn, and they double back toward the lions.
A casts Fireball from the air, and incinerates 4 of them, and making a lonely, weaping widow out of the fifth.
As the smoke rises, it spells out "EPIC".

While in the air, A gets a sense of the landscape.
He sees a watering hole to the north with a hundred unicorns.
He also sees Illitheria's plateau.
The gang return with the unicorns to Cray, who is only half way back to the forest,
and is easily visible against the grass.
He agrees (out of obligation) to come with us, but won't ride a unicorn.
He sits with Drazda on the disk.
The unicorns take us to the watering hole.

The gang crest a ridge and enter a valley.
There is a chain of watering holes.
The water is colourful, and indeed the wet unicorns are rainbow coloured.
They each have individual conversations with unicorns.
- B chats up some unicorns, and learns that the consider this place their home.
It is a place of refuge.
He also finds out that the water is temporary (there is a dry season?).
He learns nothing of the bones of dead unicorns.
- E discovers that no one knows why the water is colourful.
They also run through the plains in the direction of Illitheria (about 12 hours away).
The gang decide to ask some unicorns to take them the rest of the way to Illitheria after a rest.
The unicorns agree after A takes the Storm Lord into his heart.
- A says a prayer to his household goddess, and drinks the water.
He then collects a memento: a mother-of-pearl, 
and spends the evening playing with unicorns.
- V interests a unicorn in Umbo, and discovers that a nasty and intelligent tornado passed through the plains
7 full moons ago (about 56 months ago PMT).
Seeing A praying to another god so soon after taking the Storm Lord into his heart,
V prays to Umbo and drinks the water as well.
He shows the unicorn his water walking trick.
He spends the evening carving a holy symbol for the unicorn.

The gang sleep on a raised plateau safely above the unicorns.
The sun is clearly going down in the north.
There is about 24 hours (PMT) of daylight left.
They head to the opal plateau.
About 8 hours into their journey,
they encounter very localized (in space and time) storms of baseball-sized gem-like hail,
which shatter and disappear after falling.
They only seem to happen around us, every 15 minutes or so,
and seem to be directed at us.
The unicorns suggest that they are directed at those who are not righteous.
The unicorns manage to avoid them easily.

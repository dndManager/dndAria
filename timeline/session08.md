# Tigris and the Fraidies

The gang note that many of the discovered items match the list of missing items from Leoni.
Instead of exploring further, they decide that their mission is complete and return to Leoni with the items.
The gang take for themselves the items not on the list, including some fine (but strangely non-magical) weapons and armour.
A takes ...
E takes ...
S takes ...
V takes splint armour ("Stealther"), a battleaxe ("Berserker"), and a handaxe ("Insight").

Before they get to Leoni, they are made aware of a general alarm: there is an attack on Tigris, a village about 2 hours from Leoni.
The people of Leoni are too afraid to confront the (presumed) goblins in Tigris.
Geoffrey agrees to take the gang to Tigris, with horses and a wagon (where the gang deposit their loot).

They find Tigris abandoned. 
A few citizens lurk in the wood, guard the approach road, and keep watch on the attackers.
The watchers indicate that the attackers are collected in a central building.
There are many goblins and a hobgoblin there.

The gang hatches a plan to sneak around the building, and attack from the two doors at once.
S and E take the far door, and V and A take the near one.
V is not so successful at the stealth, and goblins burst through the windows and doors to engage the group.
With some help from archers in the woods (and a use of thunderwave that may have converted some villagers), the gang is victorious.

Back at Leoni, the gang realize that some of the items from the list were magical before being stolen, but are no longer so.
Among them are magical sickles (names: ...).
After returning the items and the money, the gang returns to EPIC with some samples of items that seem to have lost their magic.

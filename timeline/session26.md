# No Business Like Gnoll Business

V did an amazing job stabilizing all of the militia.
They dispose of all the gnoll bodies.
Based on the number of packs, 
there were probably under 60 gnolls;
less the 18 that were killed.
Humans and the gang spend the night in the fireplace room
with no further problems from the gnolls. 

Morning is heavy rain and cold, but no wind.
The gang leaves the militia to fortify the keep and to go get reinforcements from nearby villages.
The gang goes hunting for gnolls, along with one guide.

E distinguishes 1, 2, 3, and 4 day old tracks, composed of 4, 5, 4, and 5 gnolls respectively.
They decide to follow the 2 day old tracks,
which head northwest.
2 hours in, they find a wrecked homestead with dead cows.
1.5 hours further,
the tracks come to a path.
In one direction they are near a village, Eastbourne.
The tracks go the other way.
The gang decide to go to the town.

The path is forested.
It goes along the south part of the village, with a T-intersection with the main road of the town going north.
On either side of the road are village structures, and the forest closes in on the village.
There are 12 buildings in the village total.
The gang hangs back, and S parkours on rooftops,
and finds a 10yo inside a building looking out.
S and the boy talk, and S learns that the people in the village are cautious and worried,
and that there are many drunks at the inn, The Brass Thorne.
The gang go there.

Everybody is drunk off the Gnoll Blues Booze which is a mixture of all the 
strongest alcohol, though it doesn't have an interesting flavour.
A meal of braised pheasant is served.
A reads the diary:
it is the diary of Izdor.
It is full of writing.
There are 2 pages of writing in Common, and it is boring.
Then there are 2 pages of writing in Draconic, which just repeats what was said.
And then again in Elvish, Dwarvish, and other languages A can't read.
He counts 20 languages.

Meanwhile, S and E (?) leave the inn to find the leader of the village.
They learn that the people here are resigned to death by gnoll.

The gang and guide return to the keep via a direct route.
The windows are stuffed with packs, and the door is blocked by rubble.
They have put up barricades.

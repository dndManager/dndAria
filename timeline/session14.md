# Trouble follows

The gang sail back to EPIC on the Skeleton Crew, with no further difficulties (and an increase in power).
They report their findings to Matilda (?), and hold onto the orb, and try to keep it a secret.

S is confronted by a 4th year student, Muhki, who accuses him of stealing 1000gp from his vault.
S manages to convince Muhki that he didn't do it, and discovers that another rogue, Roke, mentioned that S would be the only other rogue student at EPIC capable of doing it.
To forestall any further suspicion, S steals some of Muhki's money, and plants it on Muhki's barbarian friend during dinner.
The gang briefly investigate the vaults with Muhki.

The gang debate what to do with the orb in the near term.
The gang decides to keep it in their room (against V's objection; so he sleeps in his armor).
A four-armed skeleton minotaur appears in a worker's bedroom, and almost gores a worker to death.
The gang defeat the skeleton.
They sneak the orb onto the boat, heal the gored worker, and try to gaslight the remaining witnesses.

The next morning, they report to Halgruk, and put the orb in a box in Halgruk's office.
But shortly thereafter, 3 skeletons appear in the office.
The gang gets Matilda and tell her the situation; she makes short wrok of the skeletons.
The gang figures out that the orb spawns skeletons in shadows within 60' of it whenever it is in the dark.
The type of skeleton appears random.
So they put a continual flame in the box with the orb.

The next day, Halgruk calls the gang in for a mission.
Apparently, a 21 year-old human Leaflander, who was supposedly kidnapped and missing since he was a child, returned.
A Leafland emissary is asking for help;
the gang will investigate and help as they can.

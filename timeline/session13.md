# Skeleton Crew

The gang regroup.
They determine that the island is floating: it is not attached to the bottom of the lake.
They explore the outside.
They climb up the spire.
They determine that the island has four-fold rotational symmetry.
There are lots of boats of would-be adventurers around.
The gang steal some supplies and treasure from these.

They venture back into the cave, and to the lower chamber.
They hatch a new plan:
they will push the skeletons into pool so as not to destroy them,
to try to prevent them from respawning.

When they get into the lower level,
they succeed in pushing most of the skeletons into the water
(including with the net).
They even manage to push the minotaur in.

The gang use the time they have to explore the chamber.
There is a metal railing at the bottom of the pool attached to the island
(which is like a column).
V tries to move it, but can't.
A and S look at the mushroom-shaped statues again.
They find writing all over the walls.

A casts a ritual to read the writing.
In the mean time, a minotaur appears in the room.
Under a flog cloud, E, S and V manage to push the minotaur into the water,
while A completes the ritual.
The writing says: "Death to all".

The gang realize that there is a blue orb in the island.
They manage to twist open a circular hatch on top of the island
and acquire the orb.

When they leave with the orb,
the gang takes one of the abandoned sailboats with them.
The sailboat is christened Skeleton Crew.

# Dem Bones

The gang take a short rest, during which time the skeleton remains vanish.
They move forward through the tunnel,
and encounter a large (90' diameter) circular chamber with four entrances in the cardinal directions
and a set of stairs leading down against the NW wall.
In the center of the ceiling is a very tall opening,
possibly through the tall spire as a chimney.
They hear clanking, and step back into the corridor for a tactical advantage.
They defeat another three skeletons, again with the symbol on the back of their skulls.
Again, they vanish after defeat.

The gang explores the chamber.

After exploring the chamber, they see a light in the north passage.
Two humans call out to the gang.
But they trigger a trap, and they fall.
The gang saves them, and one regains consciousness.
It turns out these are fishermen who foolishly decided to go treasure hunting.
The gang hear some clanking down the stairs below;
they encounter a skeleton horse, who they defeat before it has a chance to get up the stairs.
It also has the symbols on the back of its skull, and it also vanishes.
After a stern talking-to, the gang guides the men past the traps in the north passage, and the men leave.

The gang explores the chamber further.

The gang goes down the stairs and find another chamber, 
about the same diameter as the chamber above, 
with stairs leading further down,
and four entrances in the intercardinal directons.
The gang may have fought another skeletal horse here.

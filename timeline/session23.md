# The Crossroads*

S denies knowing Bart.
Bart has to go, but offers to meet at the inn (Foolish Gambler) later.
The gang learn that S is 27 years old.

The Crossroads is a trading village centered on the intersection of a north-south road and an east-west road.
It is surrounded by a wooden palisade.
There is an open-air market on the southwest side of the town
with about 100 people, but it is finishing up.

As the gang approach the center of the town (the crossroad),
they see a 2-story obelisk at the intersection.
There is a tall (6'5") man in a tophat, standing very stright by the statue;
this is Ashud, mayor of The Crossroads.
He greets the gang (as he greets all passers-by).
The gang learn that this is the end of the harvest festival.
It is but one of three festivals in the year,
the other two being the spring and midsummer festivals.

West of the intersection are the stables.
On the northeast corner of the intersection is the mayor's house.
To the east is an inn, with a sign that depicts a hand holding cards with an ace up the sleeve
(this must be the Foolish Gambler).

The gang spend time at the inn.
There are 4 men gambling there.
One is a big, loud man with a big, red, braided beard.
This is Greldork Hawkstone,
and they are playing a game of Hook, and it looks like he might be cheating.

The inn is packed for dinner.
The gang gets a table, and V goes to the bar.
Behind the bar are jars full of pickled eyeballs.
The bar serves Unspeakable Gas Cloud Alt Bier and Pressure-fried Black Pepper Rabbit.
V purchases four drinks, drops a pickled wolf eye in each, and gives the drinks to the gang.
V and S enjoy them.
A refuses the drink, even after V fishes out the eye with his hand.
E is mortified when he discovers the eye half-way into drinking.

Bart is at a table with a bunch of humans.
He remembers S at a lake a couple of days west of here.
S is a notable gnome.
Apparently S, Bart, and a female halfling named Lindsay created havoc there
(cow-tipping, ransacking).
S claims not to remember any of this.

Greldork offers the gang a game of Hook.
A and S think they can beat him at his own game.
E decides that, if he joins on Greldork's team, the gang can guarantee a win.
Despite excellent playing on the part of A and S, 
E manages to give Greldork the win.
E is happy for the whole gang.

The gang spend the night at the inn.
The next day, on their way to the stables,
they encounter a man putting up a "Help Wanted: Gnolls" sign.
This is Joe, a subsistence farmer from the north,
who works in dairy and a little forestry.
He has a wife and horse, who the gang believe to be distinct.
He says that gnolls have been camping at a ruin a couple of days north.
They have been raiding the farms and eating livestock.
The gang agree to help, despite the modest reward.

They proceed to the stables, and are met by a well-build, red-haired woman who resembles Greldork.
They acquire a mule, and name it Ferris Muler.
They meet back up with Joe, and all head north.

They spend the day travelling.
To the east, and especially northeast, the land is more populated and forested.
They camp for the night.
The next day, 
after a few hours of travelling,
they are taken to a trail going west, to Joe's farm.
West of that, says Joe, is a marshy area with the ruin.
The gang leave Ferris Muler at the farm,
and go to the keep as evening approaches.

The area is marshy with low trees.
There is an old keep on a hill rising from the water,
north west of the gang.
The keep is two stories tall, with basically no roof.
The path winds through the marsh to the keep.
There is a light in the keep.

The gang ambush two gnolls on patrol, and take them out before they can alert the others.
They go to the north (where the main entrance is),
and go in.
There is a main hallway going north-south, with a room in each of the corners.
To the right is a library.
To the left, a room with a suit of armour and a rug.
The gnolls are using the far left as a camp.
The far right has stairs going up and down.

The gang battle the gnolls and a gnoll captain in the hallway, with the help of Ratrick.
They push into the camp room to kill the remainder.
One tries to escape, but A hunts him down.
In all, they kill 7 gnolls and 1 gnoll captain.

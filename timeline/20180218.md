# Assault on ogre camp

Two ogres come to check on their buddies. 
The Team successfully evades them.
The ogres grab the Displacer Beast corpse and head back NE.

Alidris casts Alarm and Find Familiar (Raven) as a rituals.
Vargan plans to cast Aid at midday. 

The Team plans to track the ogres hoping to find a hideout.
Team finds a livestock field with a fence that has been trampled.
Alidris fixes the fence with some hard work. 

Find 2600 CP, 1500 SP, 40 GP, and 7 gems worth 50 gp each.

Spent the night at a farmhouse that was not abandoned but nobody was home.
The following day the temperature dropped to 30 F below normal, 
i.e. below freezing. 
The party continued on 2 hours up the trail and found two people to a trail 
off to the east that do not appear to be moving.

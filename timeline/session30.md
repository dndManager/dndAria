# Common Dreams

Sevro, Errich, and Boert have a simultaneous dream in a hazy world
where they can communicate telepathically but no sounds are heard. 
The ground they walk on appears to be made of peat moss and every stpe they 
talk results in an indentication that quickly fills with water.
Initially separated, they quickly gather around a leafless, seemingly-dead, 
tree 10 feet in diameter.

They spot a couple of lizardfolk who hasten to destroy the party. 
The warlock impresses the rogue and ranger with his Eldritch Blast and 
similarly the warlock is impressed with the sneak attack and 
sharpshooter (despite many misses) damage
After quickly dispensing of the aggressive lizardfolk, they pull up some peat 
moss to dispose of the bodies and realize they are standing upon a lake.

Boert conjures up a fish to explore the lake. 
In the dimly lit water, the fish discovers the large tree is essentially 
suspended by the peat in the water.
Eventually the fish realizes the waters are infested with crocodiles who appear 
to have no interest in the freshly slain lizard folk. 

Errich uses the Bag of Tricks to summon a panther (I don't remember why) that
gets attacked and killed behind the tree by a "pack" of four crocodiles.
The crocodiles engage the party while a lizardfolk shaman,
with a red amulet, spikes the ground 
under their feet to prevent escape. 
Impressive use of Cloud of Daggers, Horde Breaker, and Sneak attack are 
able to defeat the attackers.

Sevro immediately investigates the amulet which vanishes into thin air when 
he picks it up.

A lizardfolk king arrives and knocks Boert unconscious with a single swing. 
A quick Cure Wounds by Errich brings Boert back to life only to be knocked
unconscious again. 
Eventually the party is able to defeat the threat only to have an even 
larger lizardfolk kill them all.

Each member of the party awakes shivering and drenched in a cold sweat.

# Abandon Ship

EPIC has been more chaotic lately.
Halgruk is rarely seen, and Matilda is running the show.
Teachers are not always there.
The gate is less well guarded, so it is not an issue to go in and out.
There are frequently council folk about.

The gang discover that the arms of the horsemen they encountered on the way back from the Omba temple
are those of King Harold.
Some students recall that, 1.25 years ago,
he invited them into his castle for the night.
The King seems nice.

V goes to the Order of the Phoenix camp and finds Zaben there.
Zaben mentions that the horsemen there were a sergeant of Harold and two underlings,
who were looking for the gang at the temple because (apparently) they were worried for the gang's safety.
V also secretly joins the Order of the Phoenix, and accepts an amulet.

Alidris made 3 maps for Matilda:
- Red orb map was okay
- Island map was the best
- Area map was intermediate in quality
He was paid enough for the high quality supplies with some left over.

The gang head out to Leafland via Siridila (where Alidris's map shop is),
rowing across the freshwater lake in Halgruk's Folly.
They try to dock HF at Laketown, but it was too expensive to leave it there.
So they head up the road to Siridila, carrying the boat with them.

The area is unforested, rolling hills.
Within hours, they come across a farmstead, 
and offer the farmer 1gp (?) to leave the boat in his care.
That farmer's name: Jeff Boatstash. 
The gang stay overnight, and enjoy a nice breakfast with him until heading up the road again.

The next day passes with almost no issue.
In an area of tall grasses, they hear the sounds of a chase.
A sends up a raven to have a look.
Three ogres are chasing a displacer beast (holding a dead ogre), and they are all heading towards the gang.
The ogres kill the displacer beast, 
and then the gang kill the ogres. 

The gang recover some money and successfully skin the displacer beast.

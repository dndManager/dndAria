# Down the Rabbit Hole

The gang falls from the sky and land in a pile of mossy ground.
The ground is uneven and waterlogged.
To the west is a very brightly coloured forest, more vibrant but less dense than Leafland.
The sky is hazy, but there is light streaming through the haze.
It's foggy.

The gang collect themselves (sans S), and run in pursuit of Valmo.
There are several dead trees in the moss.
Seeing that she is leaving footprints,the gang return to their landing spot.
They test (using arrows) if there is a passage there to Leafland, but find no evidence of one.
They mark the trees from the nearby forest to relocate the landing spot.
In the forest, they hear whispering.
E investigates, finding lizardfolk tracks.
The gang turns around, and follows Valmo's tracks.

After 3 hours, they find a giant (10' diameter) dead tree, taller than we can see in the fog.
Behind the tree is a green-skinned, ugly woman, with black hair, claws, grey clothes and shawl.
B engages in epic banter with her, while E finds footprints into a door behind the tree.
(The door slams shut.)
The hag describes the tree as her home, indicating that more than one lives there.
She goes into the tree through the door.

We try to get into the door, try investigating it, and consider burning it down.
(The latter is vetoed in case there are children inside.)
V is about to hack down the door when the hag sticks her head out a hidden window above the door.
She negotiates: kill 2 lizardfolk (get their scalps) in exchange for a conversation with her.
B counteroffers: 4 scalps for a conversation with her and Valmo, starting with a single question.
The hag agrees, and Valmo sticks her head out of the window.
We ask where the children are, and Valmo says she doesn't know ("What children?" or something).

The gang returns to the landing spot, but footprints are disappearing,
and they worry that they won't be able to find their way back.
They send A's raven back and forth to keep track of the way, but it lost the way.

B surmises that this is the Feywild, based on the stories from his grandparents.
But the stories never included the mossy bog.

The gang camp for a rest.
They are ambushed by 5 lizardfolk, but kill 3, and the remaining 2 run away.

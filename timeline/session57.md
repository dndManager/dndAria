# Contract Labour; or: Working Under the Table

The following tale was told to the chronicler by a surprisingly knowledgeable halfling:

>The day started with Vargan developing some new skills and spending time with Matilda, Alidiras developing some new skills and tending to Telemnin and Fireforge, Krotho exploring the work details, and Erich trailing Krotho from a distance, planning to follow him in case he was sent out on a work assignment. 
 
> **Scene 1**

>Krotho waits in a short line, leading to a table manned by a human. Beyond the table are a few groups of dwarves. Krotho notices that the human seems to sort the dwarves into the various groups based on their size/strength.
 
>Krotho hears the human asking each dwarf who reaches the front of the line whether or not he can read before having him sign a work contract. When Krotho reaches the front of the line, and the human asks him whether or not he can read, he says, “No.” The human hands him a contract, which he slyly reads. He notices that, contrary to the popular belief that dwarves will receive 500 silver for a month of labor, the contract promises him only 500 copper. He tries to sign an “X” over the word copper, but the human has none of it.
 
>Once the signing is sorted out, the human tells Krotho to gather his belongings because his work detail will leave for a month in just two hours. Krotho asks where they’re headed. The human says only that they’re “going to the trees”. Krotho says that he has everything he needs on him. The human responds by sending Krotho to a group of comparatively slight dwarves, befitting of Krotho’s being rather slight himself.
 
>Krotho immediately asks a few of the dwarves what they thought of Vargan’s speech. They don’t know what he’s talking about. 
 
>So Krotho heads to a group of larger dwarves and tries again. These dwarves heard the speech. Krotho says that he was totally persuaded. They say that the ideas sounded good, but they don’t think they’re realistic. Krotho learns that this group is headed to the silver mines. (We later learn that many dwarves never return from the mines, and Krotho noticed that that the contracts forgave the employer for any injury or death to the employee.)
 
>Krotho next heads to the most robust-looking group of humans, asking what they’ll be doing. They don’t know what their job will be. They just know they’re headed north. Krotho tells them that there are rumors of dragons in the North. They hadn’t heard—turns out they aren’t refugees from the North. They’re pretty uneasy when they hear Krotho’s talk of dragons. Although they look healthy, they’re unarmed and don’t look much like warriors.
 
>Krotho then heads back to the group of dwarves to whom he was assigned. He tells them that they’re being swindled: the contracts the signed say 500 copper, not 500 silver. They express concern, but also uncertainty about what to believe. Krotho loudly confronts the dwarf in charge of the group, who insists that it’s 500 silver per man. This seems to assuage the dwarves’ worries. 
 
>But Krotho persists. The human running the table comes over, showing them a contract that says 500 silver. Krotho confirms that this contract says 500 silver, but insists that his said 500 copper. The dwarves lose interest in him.
 
> **Scene 2**

>Krotho leaves, heading back to the city. Erich meets him along the way. They hatch what Erich takes to be a brilliant plan. Krotho will return to the table, with Erich walking very closely behind, hidden behind the much larger dwarf. Krotho will act drunk, insisting that he wants to sign a contract, creating a distraction, allowing Erich to slide under the table from where he will snatch the fallen contracts. Krotho and Erich will then show the dwarves that the word after “500” on the contract the blank contracts isn’t the same as the word after “500” on the contracts they themselves signed.
 
>The execution of the plan starts off well. Krotho manages to knock the signed contracts off of the table and Erich manages to grab two, both of which say 500 copper, without anyone noticing him. But the human running the table quickly signals some constables, who come arrest Krotho for public intoxication. Krotho goes willingly, leaving Erich hiding under the table. 

> **Scene 3**

>Erich slips out and heads to another table, getting in line behind a few humans. He notices that the human running the table pulls a blank contract from the top of the pile for those who say they can’t read, and from the bottom of the pile for the few who say they can read. 
 
>When Erich gets to the front, he tries to snatch a few contacts but fails. So he signs a contract, using a fake name. Then, as he turns to leave, he copies Krotho’s idea, intentionally tripping on the table, breaking a leg and sending the contracts flying. He grabs two blank ones, one saying 5000 silver where the other says 5000 copper, but otherwise identical.
 
> **Scene 4**

>Erich then heads back to town. He asks people where constables would take a drunk dwarf, learning that there’s a small jail near the town square—whence the mayor made his announcement. Erich considers heading there, telling the jailer that V sent him to collect a drunk dwarf. He thinks the idea’s very clever but he’s stopped by a nagging feeling that this course of action would lead Vargan to reprimand him for some reason.
 
>So Erich heads to Alidiras, explaining all that’s happened. Alfgar is there, too. He expresses disgust, but not surprise.
 
> **Scene 5**

>Alidiras leads them to the jail, where he asks the jailers to release Krotho into his custody, which they do.
 
>Alidiras then leads the party (Alidiras, Krotho, Erich, and Alfgar) to meet a local guard whom he trusts, Feder Binner. On the way, Krotho notices a want-ad for for a brew master at Saridila Suds. Alidiras finds Feder where he expects him to be, at a coffee shop, drinking with another guard. 
 
>Alidiras explains what’s going on, showing Feder the contracts. Feder can’t read, but he believes Alidiras. Feder, like Alf, expresses disgust but not surprise, saying that’s just how it is. He asks what Alidiras would have him do; he needs his job, and anything he does will lead to his losing it without having any positive impact. Alidiras expresses sympathy. Alidiras thanks Feder for his time.
 
>As the party leaves, Erich asks Feder if there’s a respected dwarf who would care about this, and to whom the other dwarves might listen. Feder directs them to Emner, proprietor of a 2ndquarter bar, the Victorious Hamsters Bar, named for the hamster races that provide patrons the opportunity to bet.
 
> **Scene 6**

>When the party arrives at the Victorious Hamsters Bar, Emner immediately recognizes Alfgar and greets him cordially before also recognizing Alidiras, offering a similar salutation. They exchange small talk, Emner asking where Alidiras has been, and Alidiras saying that tales of his wild adventures would fill the bar with patrons wanting to hear more, and Emner saying he would love that. Then, Alidiras gets down to business, showing Emner the contracts and explaining what’s happening. Emner is disgusted but not especially surprised. He’s willing to help however he can, but not sure what to do.
 
>At this point, nearly 90 minutes have past since Krotho first stood in line to investigate the work details. That leaves around 30 minutes before Krotho’s party heads for the trees, and the larger dwarves head for the mines. Should they take Emner to the dwarves, having this trusted sage confront them with evidence that they’re being swindled before these groups depart? Should they play a long game, using the evidence to quietly foment anger toward those who run the city? The party is unsure. But they are sure that there’s one person they should consult before making any decision. Vargan.

# Punch-Drunk Lava

The gang, in the crypt, searches the remaining sarcophagi and the room.  They find nothing.

There are two wooden doors out of the room.
K, who is suddenly feeling alert, volunteers to search for traps on the left door.
He stumbles around, barely able to find the door, but fortunately there are no traps.
The door is one that slides up; E, V, and A take turns lifting it, according to their heights.

The door opens into a winding passage, to a dead end.
A investigates suspiciously, and, hearing a rumbling, finds a thunderstone mine trap.
Being the wizard he was always meant to be,
he disables the trap, and the gang keep it for later use.
At the dead end, there is a secret passage leading back to the steam room.

The gang again fail to find anything interesting in the steam room, including the mosaic.
V takes a few stones from the mosaic for his collection.

The gang return to the crypt.
Since he didn't kill himself or others last time, 
K volunteers to search the right door for traps.
Again he stumbles around, again barely able to find the door, but again there are no traps.
This time the door slides down.
K starts to pull the door down; it is warm, and a glow comes out of the room from the ceiling.
He stops half-way and the gang get a partial look at the room.

The room is large (35'x35').
In the corner of the room in front of the door is a column of lava
that rises from the ground to the ceiling.
At the top of the column, the lava spills into duct (a lavaduct?)
that spirals down from about 6' high (at the corner) to about 1' high (back at the corner),
making one continuous 25'x25' loop.

The gang suspects mephits.
They try to devise a plan, but decide instead not to overthink it,
and just charge in and attack.
K runs in, spots two lava-like lumps in the lavaduct, 
and smacks and punches one.
V goes in the room, stands in front of the door, and spots two more lumps.
He calls down the blessing of the storm lord to himself, E, and, for the first time, K.
E stays in the crypt, but tosses in a panther from the bag of tricks. 
It attacks a lump, and then sneaks under the lavaduct 
to the center of the spiral.
A is disappointed that he won't be able to use Fireball.

The fight begins in earnest.
10 magma mephits rise from the lavaduct.
The gang barely fends off a series of breath weapons and a Heat Metal spell;
K, V, and A are all seriously hurt, and V had to drop his axe and loses concentration on Bless.
The mephits explode when killed, and this starts taking its toll on K.
The panther soaks up some damage before dying (maybe earning the name Deadpan?), possibly saving K's life.
But K stands, facing the hoard with his fists.
V shatters a stack of mephits, before retreating to the crypt.
E starts picking them off with his arrows,
and A distributes magic missles like Santa on Christmas.
K finally retreats into the crypt, followed by the remaining four mephits.
One more bless and another round of attacks finishes them.

The gang return to the lava room.
The room has an iron door and two wooden doors.
E helps everyone with some healing.
While V casts Prayer of Healing, E investigates the room for traps.
The nice wooden door (with carvings inlaid in green) has an acid trap that E avoids.
The simple wooden door (with dark streaks on it) has a fire trap that E notices before setting it off.
There are no other traps in the room.

The gang return to the mirror room to spend the night, using the thunderstone mine and Alarm for security.
The room no longer seems to provide the effects of extra rest.

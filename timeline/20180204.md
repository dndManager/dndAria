# Heading to Leafland

Alidris made 3 maps for Matilda:

- Red orb map was okay
- Island map was the best
- Area map was 


Head out to Leafland via Siridila (where Alidris's map shop is).
Tried to dock boat at Laketown, but it was too expensive.
Left the boat with Jeff Boatstash and stayed overnight. 

Ogre killed a Displacer Beast and the Team killed 3 Ogres. 
Recovered some money

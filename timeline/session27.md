# Gnoll Fang of Yeenoghu's Headdress*

The gang hear gnoll sounds east southeast of the keep.
They double-time in that direction for an hour and a half.
They find a farmstead with a 20' house 20' from the woods, 
a large barn 20' behind the house, and a pasture on the far side.

The gang sneaks up to the barn where 11 gnolls are sleeping. 
After investigating the ransacked, but empty single-room house, 
fearless S walks right up to the barn door.
S has delusions of grandeur as he imagines setting the barn on fire and killing
all the gnolls inside. 
He spots one sleeping gnoll, but doesn't quite kill it.
After successfully lighting the barn on fire, 
S jumps outside thinking his job well done.

V follows and notices a group of sleeping gnolls upstairs.
He [shatters](http://engl393-dnd5th.wikia.com/wiki/Shatter) and number of gnolls
upstairs and blows out a the roof with a couple of gnolls with it.
(It turns out that shatter probably doesn't work like this, 
but it was fun while it lasted.)
As the only member of the team still in the barn,
V dodges the gnoll onslaught and casts 
[Sanctuary](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Sanctuary#content) on himself
which completely befuddles 
[Gnoll Fang of Yeenoghu](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/neverwinter_gamepedia/thumb/d/dd/Fang_of_Yeenoghu.png/280px-Fang_of_Yeenoghu.png?version=ead930a369ced1188faa38fd1a303e67)
and his allies.

A, who had a good vantage point to see the roof explode and gnolls sent
hurtling through the air from the safety of the farmhouse, 
sends magic missiles to any alive gnolls who come out of the barn.
(The DM imagines that he was drinking a finely brewed cup of coffee while 
waiting for the next gnoll). 

E sneaks around to the other side of the barn and let's loose the 
[Bag of Tricks](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Bag%20of%20Tricks#content)
which results in two boars (Boaris) who race to kill off any gnolls they see. 
The boars successfully occupy and kill a gnoll, 
leaving E to use 
[sharpshooter](http://engl393-dnd5th.wikia.com/wiki/Feats) and 
[horde breaker](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ranger#toc_23) to 
deal damage to 
[Gnoll Fang of Yeenoghu](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/neverwinter_gamepedia/thumb/d/dd/Fang_of_Yeenoghu.png/280px-Fang_of_Yeenoghu.png?version=ead930a369ced1188faa38fd1a303e67)
and his close allies 
through the center of the barn.

Staggering from the arrows through his chest in both directions, the 
[Gnoll Fang of Yeenoghu](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/neverwinter_gamepedia/thumb/d/dd/Fang_of_Yeenoghu.png/280px-Fang_of_Yeenoghu.png?version=ead930a369ced1188faa38fd1a303e67)
attempts a desparate, but I'll fated attempt to escape. 

S claims Gnoll Fang of Yeenoghu's 
[headdress](https://previews.123rf.com/images/stylishtramp/stylishtramp1305/stylishtramp130500751/19786450-native-american-indian-chief-headdress-indian-chief-mascot-indian-tribal-headdress-indian-headdress-.jpg) 
for himself.
V puts the Gnoll Fang of Yeenoghu's head on a stake, as a warning to the other gnolls.
They also find 2sp.

After a short rest, the gang return to the keep.
There are now 20 militiamen managing it, and Fredrick Cappy is the captain.
Since they are no longer needed there,
the gang return to Joe's farm and retrieve Ferris Muler.
They enjoy a dinner of stew, bread, and milk, courtesy of Joe,
and sleep overnight there.

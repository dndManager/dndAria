# Net Profit

The gang explores the top two levels of the island dungeon, getting a good look at the layout.
Each has a central chamber, with passages (spokes) leading out in four directions.
Intersecting these passages is a circular corridor that is concentric with the chamber.
There are traps at various locations.
S finds a trap that involves nets.
The gang hatches a plan to capture (but not destroy) some skeletons,
in case that prevents them from respawning.

They cut out from one of the traps a 30'x30' net.

The gang finds a deeper level to the dungeon.
It is a large, dark chamber, more than 100' in diameter.
There is a pool in the center (maybe 30' in diameter?),
and an island (10' in diamter?) of sorts in the pool.

# Hearses and Horses

E loots the bearded devil, and harvests some poison.
V mourns A loudly, and tells the others that if they want to sleep they will have to sleep outside.
E and S make camp outside the temple,
while V stays inside praying and tending the body.
V feels like the death had no higher purpose, but that this is likely a temple of Umbo.

The gang create a stretcher for V to drag A's body.
On their way back south,
they encounter a white stag running east, and making wide circles around them.
E gives chase, but can never get near him.
They figure out that it is likely a guardian of some sort.

The stag alerts the gang to an oncoming threat.
E hides the gang in the woods.
They see three horses with armoured human riders are approaching at high speed.
The humans have swords and shields, and the shields bear an emblem:
a shield with battlements atop,
field parted per pall reversed,
with a grey tower, blue river (branched), and green tree.
The horses continue north at full speed, and the gang carries on south.

The gang encounters a firesnake (?), and makes short work of it.
They evaded the horses a second time?
E notices that the horses came on a path from the west, and then went south to the Order of the Phoenix camp.
There are riders at the camp.
The gang decides to steal the horses.
E and S engage in some subterfuge, 
and there was a small/medium mammal that scurried away from the encampment.
The gang steals the horses and rides to Larton.

At Larton, there are 10 drunks on the street, and another 10 standing at the docks.
The boat is missing.
Four drunks seem to have stolen it and are on the water.
V runs at them over the water with glowing eyes and a loud voice,
and intimidates them into abandoning the boat.
He rescues them, and brings the boat back.
The gang pays some drunk townsfolk to take the horses back to the camp.

The gang rush back to EPIC.
Matilda can't do anything for A herself; though she is motivated to save him because they have a job for him
("he's just the one we need").
She calls for Larissa to help.
(Other students talk about Larissa as a rumoured powerful magic user 
in a tower in the wasteland south of EPIC.)
In the mean time, 
the gang discovers from Matilda that the emblem of the horsemen is that of King Harold;
the kingdom is NE of Gateway, and is friendly.

Some time later, a black stallion arrives at EPIC, with a rider in all black clothing,
purple skin, and a tail.
She performs a dark ritual on A, for the cost of a 500gp diamond (which she brings),
and EPIC lends the gang the money.

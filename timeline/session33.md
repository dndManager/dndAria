# Unexpected Company

The gang rest by the river.
They hear shuffling in the bushes: a brown bear.
After A's fireball and B's eldritch blast,
the bear was (poorly) skinned, and the gang harvested the meat.

B leaves the gang to get his fishing gear.
Meanwhile, the gang discuss E and S's dream (which included B), 
about their death temple experience (A was ambushed behind the door),
and whether (and with what) they can trust B.
When B returns, they all eat expensive (!) eels.
B tells them about himself: he and his family are in the eel business, and he is a gambler (he gambles in Siridila).
The gang decides they need to return to Siridila, but since they don't know where they are,
and B was heading there anyways, B leads the gang to Siridila.

On the way to Siridila,
S notices markings on a tree, indicating treasure nearby.
S stops everyone, and goes to have a closer look.
The gang is ambushed by human bandits, but before combat can begin, 
one of the bandits, a woman named Talia, recognizes S.
S remembers that he saved her life (from quicksand?).
In gratitude, 
she says she has something for him, 
and walks away with him.

They are gone for half an hour,
during which the gang discuss the best way to initiate combat.
When S returns, he was evasive about what happened,
and claimed that Talia just showed him the bandits' hideout.
The gang and the bandits part ways.

A is suspicous of S.
He secretly casts detect thoughts, and detects that S is obsessively thinking about a dagger with a green gemstone.
A takes V aside (pretending that he had to poop),
and shares his worries that S was somehow enchanted into a mission.
They decide to get more information.
They return, and A secretly casts detect magic.
He takes V aside again (using the same excuse),
and reveals that S does not appear to be enchanted,
but he now has a magic dagger, 
and that V was wearing a magical amulet.
The latter surprised V.

The gang arrived in Siridila that evening,
and went to A's home.
It had been broken into, and people had gone through his things, apparently looking for something.

Alfgar gave A a map of Leafland made by A's grandfather.

That evening,
A decides to identify the dagger and amulet.
The dagger has a green gem in the butt of the hilt, and the gem has a cloudy swirl inside it.
It is a magical dagger that can do extra psychic damage on sneak attacks.
The amulet is an amulet of rebirth.

They will head to Leafland tomorrow.
B decides to join the gang there, since there are supposed to be rare eels there whose eggs he can harvest.

# Battle of Gnoll's Keep

E negotiates with the militia for half of the remaining loot.

A casts Detect Magic, and the gang wander around the keep.
He finds that there is faint magic (divination) at a wall behind rubble and rotted shelving.
He sends a spider familiar around, and finds a secret room behind the wall.
In the room is a shrine (a sculpture of a scroll) to Ogma, 
god of knowledge (accumulation and study, not associated with damage).
There is also a small chest.

There doesn't seem to be a secret door; the shrine is just bricked up.
V uses a crowbar and mason's tools to pick a hole in the wall, 
big enough for E and S to squeeze through.
V tells them that, before touching anything,
they must tell a secret.
E says that he is secretly happy that he was sent away from Leafland.
S says that he has been secretly stealing from houses.

The small chest contained 4 scrolls:
- Comprehend Languages in Common
- Tongues in Draconic
- Speak with Animals Elvish
- unknown 

Militia heard [Gnoll calls](https://www.soundsnap.com/tags/hyena).
It's dark, and rainy.
The gang do some scouting, but don't see the gnolls.
So they set up a defense of the keep, and wait.

V is at the front door, A and S are in the library,
and E is on the roof.
E directs four militiamen on the roof.
Two militiamen are in the back, protecting windows.
Two militiamen are in the armour room, protecting the windows.
One militiaman is in the library (?), and one is with V (?).

10 gnolls attack, in two groups of 5, one group left of the door and one from the right.
Each group has 1 captain.
The door held,
but gnolls got in through the windows.
The defense was successful, but 6 militiamen fell.

# Blowing Off Steam, or: Dust to Dust

The gang are in the dusty room, looking to go through the locked iron door.
A sends his spider through the keyhole to scout ahead, 
through a passage that snakes around before ending at a wooden door.
V pops the hinges of the iron door with a crowbar, 
and E leads the gang to the wooden door, inspecting for traps.

The wooden door is nice, and appears to be made for decoration.
A sends the spider underneath, and finds a room with what appear to be wax blobs all over the floor,
fungus on the right wall,
and a stone door on the opposite wall.
V and K bash down the door with enough force
that the door hits the round while they are left standing on it.

The room has cut marks all over the walls, as if a sword had been taken to them.
The fungus is large, morrel-like, and has tentacles waving around menacingly.
E tosses a lit torch into the middle of the room, but nothing happens except that the wax melts.
The fungus creatures attack, but they are very slow, and the gang kills all four easily.

The ceiling of the room is normal.
Wax covers the entire floor except where the fungus was.
E and V are careful not to step on the wax, but A walks into the middle of the room.
Reminded that he is leaving waxy footprints,
he uses a torch to obscure them.
V scrapes a path to the stone door.

The door has no obvious way of opening (no hinges, handles, or keyholes).
V uses the crowbar on various sides of the door, and manages to pry it open
(it swings into the room).
Inside is just a small passage/room, with 57cp and 8ep.
The gang spend time in the new areas of the basement, and discover no new secrets except:
A triggers an acid spray trap in the corner of the wax room (that dissolves some wax and some of A).

The gang return to the mirror room.
They examine the tapestry again,
noting that the sun is rising in the image,
that the keep in the image is modest (1 storey, except for the four corners that have 2 storey towers),
and that there is nothing interesting on the back.
They bring Drazda and Cray to this room, in case it helps her like it helped them.

The gang return to a (previously explored but abandoned) dead end passage and find a secret door.
The door is at the edge of the opal part to the dungeon.
The gang surmise that the opal parts of the basement are under the opal plateau, and the granite parts are under the plains.
The granite would have had to be brought under when the basement was built, while the opal parts were dug through.

The room is in the granite area.
It has an ornate stone mosaic ceiling in a geometric pattern.
The floor has holes with steam coming out, much like the smoke holes.
The rooms starts to fill with steam, and the steam starts to drift toward the door.
V casts Gust of Wind, and blows the steam away, and drives 3 steam mephits (?) to the opposite wall.
They can be blurry and thus hard to hit,
but the gang manages to defeat them while keeping them at bay.
Boris died an honourable death taking out a mephit.

One wall in the room has a wooden door.
E investigates the room for traps, and there is an arrow trap from the ceiling above the wooden door.
The door itself is not locked, so A Mage Hands the door open, triggering the trap.
The door opens into a room with 4 sarcophagi, or perhaps 4 sarcophaguses.
The sarcophagi have no decorations or reliefs, so V approaches one to touch it.
He sees dust on the sarcophagi,
which start to form into mephits (?).
He Shatters (while Channelling Divinity) the two near sarcophagi,
destroying them and 4 mephits,
one of which and blinds him upon dying.
The remaining two try to blind A and V (and succeed with V),
and cast sleep (but the gang were able to resist with the help of a previously cast Aid spell).
The gang reduce them to dust.

The two shattered sarcophagi contain no bones or treasure.

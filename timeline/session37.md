# Wicked Witch of the East

B continues the banter, distracting the hag.
E casts Pass Without A Trace, and snoops around.
He goes downstairs, only to find that it leads into water under the tree.
He goes upstairs, and finds three closed doors and stairs going further up.
He hears whispering in the leftmost door, but can't understand the language.
E reports this to A, who casts Tongues on him.
E returns, and hears one voice saying: "stay quiet, help is coming".

E reports this to A and V.
The conclude that the best course of action is to attack.
V asks if Hagatha knows how to get to Leafland (she claims not to know).
A battle ensues, and the cauldron (and part of the wall) is shattered.
Hagatha barks like a dog,
and 2 hags leap out of the room upstairs and onto the ground outside, running away.
Hagatha pulls a lever and the dining room floor falls into the water,
and she escapes under the water.
4 blink dogs enter the tree to attack.
The blink dogs and one of the hags are killed.

In the attic of the tree, through a trap door in the ceiling,
E finds a whimpering halfling girl, a candle, and a spinning wheel.

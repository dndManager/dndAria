# Top Gear

The gang learns that the Eavesdropping Cap works up to 100'.

Info about EPIC:
* Has a vault where they keep coins and gems.
The vault is managed by a human Knowledge Cleric of Boccob, Matilda.
* Has an armoury with lockerswhere students keep their gear.
* EPIC demands 30% of all coin.
Students can check out "rustic" gear for any adventure, but most students acquire their own eventually.
* In this region of the world, there is not much variation in daylight hours.

In the weeks following the gang return, they spend their downtime independently.
V does some masonry volunteering, and finds a site for an outdoor shrine about 30 minutes from EPIC along the shore.

Halgruk has the gang go to Grakas to resupply.
They must get:
* Food (from a grocer with whom EPIC has a relationship)
* Weapons and armour (from a blacksmith)
* Wood (for building and repairs)
* Spell components

They are given money enough for the supplies, and badges (reddish, with "EPIC" on them) to gain entrance.
They are also given a 100gp loan to acquire their own adventuring gear.

The gang finally gain entrance to Grakas, a city of about 1000 people, from the northern gate.
Past the gatehouse and bridge is another gatehouse.
Then a road continues south to a roundabout, with a statue of a human holding a two-handed sword in the middle.
The road continues south to a T intersection with the (east-west) main street.
S notes graffiti (in thieves' cant) at the intersection that indicates "quick exit" to the west, and "cheap whores" and "great food" to the east.
Beyond the main street to the south is a keep.

To the east is an inn, a general store, and a locksmith.
The gang see if S can purchase thieves' tools from the locksmith, and after some shady business S manages to get some.
They each purchase a variety of gear from the general store.

V (with S?) visits the temple on the east east.
It is an empty temple of an air god, with a retractable roof, and V has a sudden feeling of belonging.
They visit the temple on the west side (also empty; stone temple with fire patterns, a magma creature statue, and red stonework).

The others go to the inn.
They meet Merryweather, the battle-tested innkeeper.
The gang reunites there for lunch.
They discuss going back to the Hama's group's cave, to pick the lock on the secured chest.
V notices suspicious blond human man listening in.
After conferring in dwarvish, A and V spin a lie just in case the blond man was listening to their plans.
The men at the suspicious man's table have green badges with a circle, pickaxe, and "SMC" on it.

The gang leave (having left an order to be picked up?) to go back to the cave.
A and S go back in, and a terrified E stays out, while V can't fit in anymore (because of his armour).
V ties a rope around E's waist, and he slowly goes in.
In the meantime, A and S confront another spider, and S (?) goes unconscious from poison.
E is not having a good time.
But S recovers, and manages to open the chest.
Inside are:
* 5 red potions
* 2 white potions
* a bag, with a grey magic halo (they learn through trial and error it is a bag of tricks)
* a gold ring with a wave pattern, with an aqua aura (ring of water walking)
* a bag with 200gp

Back at EPIC, the gang learn of Niven and Wilbar, two gnomes in Hama's old party, 3rd years, who died.
They also get info on their first mission:
The town of Leoni, south of Grakas, was attacked by humanoids, who ransacked a vault, taking 1000gp and some keepsakes.
The gang is to investigate this, and recover the stolen goods.

# A Little Rusty

A, E, and V explore the desk room.
In the three barrels, E finds:
- coin (1900cp, 800sp, 60gp)
- 5 gems (banded agate, eye agate, malachite, moss agate, and obsidian; 5gp each)
- 2 vials:
  - oil of etherealness (whitish and oily, 10 min to apply); A takes this
  - potion of clairvoyance (whitish and airy, with wisps and an eye appearing occasionally); V takes this

On the shelf, V finds spell components:
- incense (50gp worth); A takes this
- clay
- sulphur
- phosphorus
- water
- sand; E takes this
- gold dust (25gp); V takes this

A casts Identify, and discovers the nature of the potions, that the book is kept closed by an arcane lock.
He casts Detect Magic; there is nothing else magical in the room.
In the meantime, E and V inspect the room carefully.
They discover a bookcase that is really a secret door.
After pushing this open with difficulty, they find a passage.

The passage has two branches to the right, the near one with a sulphurous smell.
E casts Pass Without A Trace, and they explore the far branch.
It winds around into a dead end.
The gang discover that the basement cuts through two kinds of stone (opal in the NE-ish part, granite in the rest).
They find a secret door opposite one that they found in the first/main room,
but they can't open it.
A determines, by Identify (?), that there is an arcane lock here too, that needs a password.
There appear to be no other secret doors.

They go back to the near branch.
It winds around ultimately to a set of stairs down, with a powerful smell of sulphur.
The gang return to the centipede room.
There, they discover that K has been dominating Clay in Rock, Paper, Scissors.
They recruit him into adventuring with them.

The gang bash down the nice wooden door in the smoke room.
It is just a short passage that ends.
A discovers a secret door (with an iron ring) back to the smoke room,
but triggers a guillotine trap on his face.
E and V manage to disable the trap and pass through the door.

E investigates the remaining door in the smoke room, an unlocked stone door.
There are little iridescent stones embedded in it, which creeps E out.
A has a look, and thinks it's a teleport trap, triggered by touching the door.
Mere objects touching the door seem not to trigger it; it must be a creature.
He sends his spider familiar onto it, and it disappears beyond his ability to detect it;
he dismisses it.
After careful study, A short-circuits the trap and opens the door, rushing through.

The gang find a short passage, and a thick, sealed, heavy stone door.
K and V try to open it by force, using their shoulders and a crowbar.
K tries on his own, but because he refused to take the Storm Lord into his heart;
he fails spectacularly, sprawling across on the ground before even getting to the door.
V investigates the door with mason's tools, and determines that it's probably too thick to shatter.
The gang retreat, defeated.

They return to the fireplace room.
E investigates the final door here: the reinforced wooden door.
He finds a guillotine trap.
K tries to trigger the trap at a distance with his quarterstaff.
Again he is offered the help of the Storm Lord, and again he refuses.
He fails spectacularly, and takes a guillotine to the face.
E casts Cure Wounds on him.
E and V manage to jam the trap, and the gang go through the door.

It opens into a passageway that is a dead end to the left,
and on the right loops around to connect with passages known to the gang.
Aside from the stairs down, the stubborn stone door, and any undiscovered secrets,
this part of the basement is explored.
After a short rest and a bit of careful investigation of a wall,
the gang return to the first/main room.

K and V force open the stone door in the first/main room (?).
It opens directly into another room.
There is a mirror on the opposite wall.
E pops in for a look.
There is a nice wooden door on the opposite wall as well.
But there are lumps of scale and tail in one corner.
Four rust monsters (?) attack the party.
E produces a panther, and K takes up a defensive position.
A monster rusts A's sword and another rusts V's axe.
V weakens them with a Shatter, killing one.

K finally shakes off the stupor, and gets to work.
He smacks one monster, then punches it,
disengages, rushes to a second monster,
and kills it, suitably impressing his new comrades.
E kills a monster threatening V.
The final monster runs away, smashing through the nice wooden door and disappearing around the corner.
A gives chase, does some wizard voodoo to get it in sight, and sends some Magic Missiles to kill it.
The gang has won the room.

There is a pile of stuff in the corner where the monsters were.

# Homewreckers; or: Stop Hurting Your Friend

The celebration continues into the night.
E decides to go back to A's home to sleep early.
K gets heavily buzzed.
V gives his rusty axe to Enmer, along with stories of the things that were killed with it.

The gang make plans for the next day.
V will sell his splint armour and donate the money to the temple of Mystra for the benefit of the dwarves.
He will also collect some party funds and buy a 300gp diamond.
K will work on his brew (?).
A borrows funds from the party to get papers and inks,
so he can spend the night copying spells.

Some time after A leaves for home, he hurries back to K and V,
and asks them to follow him to his home.
He flies under the full moon, while K and V run after.
There, A tells the full story:
he was attacked by two masked men wielding daggers (melee and thrown);
he managed to escape, and fireballed them outside his home;
the barred themselves in, shuttering the windows and door.

K opens the door and runs in.
He sees two men in studded leather looking like elite guards.
He punches one, and heads over the counter, and throws his spear.
He is attacked by them, and some effect on their weapons makes him go unconscious.
V sees none of this; he walks in and casts Shatter, hurting both, severely injuring the unconscious K (who promptly wakes up),
and breaking the counter and wall.
A sneaks into an upper-storey window, and spots a third man upstairs.
K then does some out of control monk stuff, 
forcing one man to hit the other, knocking him down.
The upstairs man rejoins the other, and they try to attack K.
Some punches, spiritual weapon hits, a Thunderwave, magic missiles, 
a brave wizard guarding a door, and a swat with V's new hammer,
and the men go down.
K keeps the last one alive.

During the battle, the gang see E unconscious in the corner;
Healing Word doesn't help, but a quick smack wakes him up.

A recognizes the men's black sashes; they are the Black Sashes, the kingdom's assassin force.
The gang loot the invaders, and find 9 daggers (?), coated in poison.
There are some vials of poison as well, which have been made so that the daggers fit in and can be coated easily.
K takes the vials and the daggers.

V binds the man, and the gang interrogate him.
He is a frustrating prisoner, so K leaves to check on the brewing equipment.
The gang discover:
- He claims his name is Gren Nordov, with no next of kin.
- The course of action he suggests is that the gang let him go.
- He won't give up his associates' names.
- He is resistent to threats and bribes. 
- They failed because of bad intel.

K offers him a drink, and he accepts.
A casts Detect Thoughts, and discovers:
- His mission is to kill the gang.
- A human fighter hired them, the very one on the stage, with a distinctive twitch.
- He was to bring the man a trinket as proof.
- They were hired that very night in some room.

One by one, A flies the bodies of the dead to the castle and drops them from height in the courtyard,
instructing the rest not to kill the remaining one.
Meanwhile, E, K, and V debate whether to kill him.
They almost settle on making him seem dead and having A unwittingly drop him from height in the castle courtyard.
But K doesn't like that idea, and stabs him instead.

At midnight, both E and K suffer more form the poison.

# To Leoni and Beyond

The gang takes the boat towards Grakas, and then to a stream south.
The stream is full of eels.
On the east bank of the stream is Leoni, a village of about 200 residents.
They see some docks and a boathouse, with a spire behind it.
They meet a child, Kurt, who tries to scam them, claiming that they must pay him a small fee to dock the boat.
There is a boathouse Captain.

The village is mostly along the stream.
The main road is N-S along the stream.
The inn, the Shocking Eel, is on the stream side of the street south of the docks.
Opposite the inn and further south is the vault.
A secondary N-S road is further inland, accessible by a street that goes E from the docks.
On this secondary N-S road is a temple.
Elsewhere in the town are stables, a grocer/store, and some residences.

The gang meets the constable, Geoffrey, in leather with an axe.
He buys the gang lunch at the Shocking Eel, where they shockingly eat eel.
Over lunch, he relates the following information.

The central vault was raided a fortnight ago by 10 small humanoids, maybe goblins, with a ferocious temper.
Leroy, a farmer to the north, witnessed their approach.
He sent his son, a young man named Landry, by horseback to alert the village.
The raiders came from the north, and returned to the north.
They carried axes and spiked clubs.
It was night, and there was a quarter moon at the time.
They seemed to know exactly where to go, and they smashed into the vault and stole money and other items.
After the raid, scouts (led by Brian) tracked them a couple of hours north along the main road, and into the woods before giving up.

Geoffrey tells them about the mayor, Charles, who is a party animal.
(He is sleeping in.)
The gang is suspicious of the mayor.
There is also Beatrice, Geoffrey's wife?
They go to the vault, where they meet the clerk, Felice.
She gives A a list of the items missing, and he copies it.
E and S investigate the vault, and find nothing.
V visits the temple and finds a former priest of the god of greed, but finds no other information.

They venture north.
They are unable to make contact with Leroy.
Since it's getting late, they decide to return to Leoni for the night.
That evening, they find mayor Charles carousing in the inn.
A, E, and V make sure he is occupied, while S sneaks into his house.
S steals some gems and such, but finds no evidence that the mayor is involved in the crime.

The next day, the gang go back to where the scouts tracked the footprints.
E identifies goblin tracks (5) and hobgoblin tracks (1).
They follow them up to a mountain with a cave entrance.
They sleep overnight without a fire,
and ambush two guards to gain entrance.
The door is made of obsidian stone, and is not new.
It is clearly not of goblin manufacture.

Inside they find a dungeon.
S leads the way, searching for traps.
There are large rooms with stone blocky statues suggesting fire or magma creatures.

# Smoke and Mirrors

The gang loot the pile that the rust monsters were on:
- 2100cp, 500sp, 90gp
- 5 gemstones at 10gp each (azurite, hematite, moss agate, obsidian, tiger eye)

The mirror is large, floor-to-ceiling and 10' wide, inset and flush with the wall, with no bevels or frame.
E investigates it, and discovers that it talks; moreover, it regularly insults him, and is abrasive towards everyone.
It seems to be the mirror, rather than something trapped in the mirror.
V hits it hard with his axe, but it just reverberates a bit, taking no damage.
A chips away at the surrounding opal wall; he sees that it's a few inches thick, but sees no evidence that it's secured to the wall.
K breathes on it, and writes in the fog; he finds out its name is Alice (but we can call it Al).
It's apparently lonely, and only had the rust monsters as company (bad company, at that).
It has a poor grasp of how much time has passed, and hoped to see the sun.

The gang decide to sleep in the room (away from the mirror).
The rest is especially effective, the equivalent of two long rests.
V, E, and A took turns on watch, while chipping away at the edge of the mirror.
By the end of the rest, the opal along the entire mirror edge was chipped away, though it still seems secure.

A cast Fly on the mirror, hoping to allow it to move from the wall, but it did not or could not move.
The gang talked to it some more, and learned:
- It was a gift from Iymbryl to Vaalyun.
- It doesn't know much about Iymbryn
- Vaalun was an elf, ruler of these parts.
He had a wife and child.
He did not appreciate the gift, and shortly after it was installed in the room, he just shut the door and didn't come back.
- There were many owners of this place, 5 more (it gave the names) over some period of time.
- A bald man with a tatooed face did pop his head in the room, but then left.
- It didn't recognize the description of Illitheria.

The gang leave the room through the nice wooden door broken by the rust monster.
It led to a dead end, with a secret passage back to the lobby.

There is one door left in the lobby: the wooden door.
It's strong, it's stuck, and it's probably trapped (it was tingly, but E withdrew in time).
The gang pull the door open with rope.
It leads to a winding passage with one dead end and a stone door at another end.
The door is locked; A does his thing and unlocks it.

The door opens into a room that has a little dust on the floor.
There is an iron door on the right wall and another iron door on the left wall.
Careful attention to the floor reveals that there is a dust-free path from the stone door to the door on the left;
someone walks this way.
The room has a tapestry depicting the setting sun and the opal plateau, but light-coloured (faded white?),
with a castle sitting on top.
On K's suggestion,
the gang take down the tapestry and install it opposite the mirror, so that it can look at (an image) of the sun.

The gang investigate the room further, and V triggers a trap and he and K are blasted with fire from a nozzle.
The iron door to the right is locked, but not trapped.
The iron door to the left is unlocked, but trapped with a pressure plate and a falling block.
The gang step over the pressure plate and through the door.

It leads to a short passage that ends in an illusory wall.
Past the wall is a room that can't be there in normal space, based on the map.
It's a small room with a nice bed and a wooden door on the opposite wall.
The gang finds an explorer's pack and a dagger under the bed; K takes these.
A casts Detect Magic, and finds there is nothing magical about the gear or room except the illusory wall.

E opens the wooden door, and sees a large room with pillars and a large brazier in the middle.
V recognizes it as the altar room of the death temple in Siridila.
He pulls E back into the bedroom room, and closes the door.
A summons his spider familiar and sends it into the room.
It appears just as E and V remember:
an altar on a dais with a sacrificing table and dagger,
pillars whispering "All must die",
writing on the wall ("Know me..."),
the door to the passage to the Cave,
and so on.
The pillar that V shattered appears to be repaired.

The gang have independent reasons to believe that they are not in the feywild anymore.
E, K, and V had to shake off some effect, possibly the same one that caused memory loss in Ria (but not Valmo).
A confirms this by using the spider (he loses contact with it when it passes through the wall).

The gang suspect that Baldy is responsible to Illitheria's disappearance.
He may have opened this passage recently, and then began to occupy the dungeon.
He might have summoned the elemental creatures they they encountered,
and may have placed K in the dungeon recently.

The gang consider some options:
- Make a run for it, and try to make it back to EPIC.
- Bring the halflings here, and try to sneak them all back that way.
- Continue looking for Illitheria and rescuing the halflings that way.

The gang decide to return to the feywild and continue looking for Illitehria.

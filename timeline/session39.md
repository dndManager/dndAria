# I am the Lizard King

The play B found is set in a land that is like Leafland.
It has 3 characters:
 - An idealized version of Valmo
 - A human girl (E recognizes her as Bluth, a 50yo woman who is a childhood friend of Valmo)
 - A halfling character, "Ankin", who E doesn't recognize
The story is about kids having adventures.
But there is a twist ending: the halfling dies.
They are playing around, and Ankin falls from height, hits head, and drowns.

The gang walks to the lizardfolk area.
B, A, and V walk the path, while E and Nedda stealthily accompany in the trees.
E hears some lizardfolk (2, wielding shields and clubs) in the woods,
and when confronted, they run.
B slows them and offers them eel; they accept.
During a conversation (including A's casting Detect Thoughts),
the gang discovers:
 - They recognize halflings
 - Their leader ("Boss Man"), a shaman, didn't want the lizardfolk to intereact with us
 - They are unfamiliar with the mask
 - They hate the hags and kill them when they can (under orders from Boss Man)
 - At least sometimes, hags without an elf bag and drag the halflings when they appear in the bog
 - They rescue halflings wandering in the bog
 - There are 40 rescued halflings living near the Boss Man (50 halflings were missing from Leafland)
 - Boss Man is interested in meeting us
One of the lizardfolk (with yellowish scales on parts of his arm?) agrees to lead the gang to Boss Man;
they encounter no further difficulty from lizardfolk guards or scouts.

The gang are led past the guard tree, and through the forest,
which is even more vibrant than the forest behind (gem outcroppings instead of rock outcroppings).
They pass through a natural gate through a natural wall (of deeply intertwined vegetation) 10' tall.
They then get to an agricultural area cleared in the forest, 
with 5 halflings working in the field.
E recognizes one of them, (name?).
This is his story:
> He was playing with Valmo.
> Suddenly, he was in a marsh with a bag on his head, and led to a tree.
> He managed to escape into the bog when the hags accidentally left the door open.
> He was then captured by the lizardfolk.
> They are not ill-treated, but conditions are not great.

Past the argicultural area is more forest (perhaps less dense than before),
and the land heads downward,
eventually into an underground area.
The walls are vegetation to begin, but become earth as it goes deeper underground.
It smells bad here; like unwashed lizardfolk.
Lizardfolk start to trail the gang.

At the end of the corridor (there are branching corridors to the right and left with some doors)
is a large (60' long, 40' wide, 15' high) chamber with a raised area akin to a throne.
Sitting there is Kiuz, the shaman.
He speaks to the gang, first in draconic, and then in common.
B gives him eels and apologies, 
and he apologizes in return.

Kiuz tells the story of Drazda, an older spellcaster who sent a halfling (Ria, who volunteered) back to Leafland.
He is happy to learn that Rian successfully returned.
But Drazda's spellcasting energy is mostly gone, as is her life force.
She is near death's door, waking up only occasionally, and usually speaking incoherently.
Her eyes are clouded over.
V asks to see her.
The gang are led through a back door to another tunnel, and into a side room.
She is asleep.
V casts Lesser Restoration and Remove Curse, and there is no obvious effect.
They decide to spend the night near her in case she wakes up.

Before taking their rest, the gang send Nedda to interview halflings,
and are guided to the nearest fast-flowing stream (half an hour away) to catch eels.
B ties himself to V, accepts the Lord of Storms into his heart, and wades into stream.
The stream is brilliant, with water that is a rainbow of pastel colours.
He manages to spear many rainbow-coloured (and very hard to see) eels.
They return the eels to Kiuz, in preparation for a feast.

The gang learn that each day here is about 96 hours, and each night is also about 96 hours.
They also learn from Nedda that the other halflings' stories match (name)'s.
She agrees to stay with the lizardfolk for now.

The gang interview the scout that Drazda took with her to perform the ritual.
They went a few hours into the bog (so, likely not far from the hag's tree)
to a large rock (20' high. 10' diameter).
She performed the ritual there (with speech and herbs), and Ria disappeared.
Drazda then collapsed (energy drawn into rock?).
He can find his way back.

The gang take their rest in rooms near Drazda.
Before resting, V casts Lesser Restoration again.
During E's watch, she awakens, but she still seems unable to communicate.
V casts Lesser Restoration a third time.
A casts Detect Thoughts, and B uses his Awakened Mind,
and they manage to communicate with her.
The gang learns:
- She used a special sentence and some herbs to perform the ritual
- The herbs consisted of ground Moon Pearls, dust from puffrooms, and cloud clay (underground)
- She (relatively) recently learned the ritual from Illitheria, possibly an elf woman (she was veiled), 
who lives on a rocky plateau 10 hours away
- She was taken to Illitheria to learn spellcasting in the first place by her mother when she was young
- Young lizardfolk get trained in spellcasting when they show aptitude

The gang convince Drazda to accompany them to Illitheria, 
since the latter may be able to help her.

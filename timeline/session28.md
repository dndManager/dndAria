# Tales of Siridila

## Journey to Siridila

The gang goes back to the Crossroads and take the west road to Siridila,
which is more well-travelled, with with humans and others regularly on the road.

About a half day west, they encounter a stench which reminds E of a swamp in Leafland.
The stench emanates from a narrow (~60') and deep (~100') chasm.
At the bottom of the chasm is a green, viscous "river" flowing N-S;
the chasm seems to etched out of the ground by acid.

Another half day west the gang come upon a small town situated where the road has a fork north.
There is a small inn (which is full), with outside tables and fires.
The gang spends the night there (?).
The next day, they travel one day north through a forested and grassy landscape to Siridila.

Siridila is a city with four quarters.
Starting in the SW and going counterclockwise, they are the poor, modest, comfortable, and wealthy quarters.
The land rises in the same way, so that the boundary between the poor and wealthy quarters is a 60' cliff,
surmounted by a 10' high wall.
The boundary between the comfortable and wealthy quarters is a 5' high fence.

A's business, "Tolemnon and Fireforge", is also his home, and is in the comfortable quarter.
His business partner, Alfgar, is a middle class hill dwarf, a middle child of a local family of business dwarfs.
He makes the gang stew.

Nearby is a leatherworker elf named Suhnae, who the gang hires to make cloaks from the displacer beast hide.
At some point, they discover that the remaining scroll is a druidic scroll about plants.
They realize that they will be spending the next couple of weeks in the city.

## The Tale of Sevro

S wanders the city looking for rumours, things to seal, and rumours of things to steal.
He meets at least one person that he apparently knows, 
and this person gives him information.

S often uses "Fibblestib" (one of his names?) when he swears.
V has picked up on this habit.

## The Tale of Vargan

V goes temple-hopping.

The poor quarter has a wooden temple with a door depicting a 5-pointed star.
The symbol is split by the door, possibly representing broken knowledge.
This is a temple to Mystra, goddess of magic and knowledge.

The modest quarter, where most dwarves live since they are day-labourers, 
has a wooden temple with some stone work.
There is a 9-tailed scourge decoration on the roofline.
This is a temple of Loviatar, goddess of pain.
V tries to plant the seeds of a ecumenical-but-Umbo-driven dwarf-nationalistic bolshevik revolution among the dwarves.

The comfortable quarter has a stone temple with a wooden roof.
On the apex is a beam from which hangs a large balance, and the balance seems to shift.
A knows this to be the temple of Tyr, god of justice.
According to A, an uprising was is what created the comfortable and modest classes, separating them from the poor.
It created a business class, and the temple symbolizes capitalism and opportunity.

V (travelling with S) was not permitted into the wealthy quarter.
He talked to some people exiting and entering the quarter, and they did not have good things to say about the temple there.
It is constructed in the shape of a human skull, whose mouth is the entrance.
There are certainly animal sacrifices going on, 
but possibly even human sacrifices.
This is a temple to Myrkul, god of death.

## The Tale of Errich

E seeks information about the missing children of Leafland, 
and about the child who returned, but comes up empty.
He discovers that the orbs are not a secret,
and that the white orb seemed to spawn tiny arachnid things called neogi hatchlings.
He supervises the creation of the cloaks (?), which have a symbol/badge involving the orbs.
The cloaks give a +1 to stealth checks at night or in the dark.
They are not magical.

## The Tale of Alidris

A spends most of his time working and studying, especially studying the scrolls.
He manages to transcribe Speak With Animals and (with the help of V) Tongues.
Using Tongues, he discovers that the remaining scroll is a Druidic scroll of Speak With Plants.
He also divides 100gp among the gang.

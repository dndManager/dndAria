# Ogre Ergo Gore

Overnight, 2 ogres come to check on their buddies. 
The gang successfully evades them.
The ogres grab the displacer beast corpse and head back NE.

The next day,
A casts Alarm and Find Familiar (Raven) as a rituals.
V plans to cast Aid at midday. 
The gang plan to track the ogres hoping to find a hideout.
They scout out the area.
Further north along the road,
there is a path that heads east.
Further north, more than a mile away, there is another path east.

The gang follows the first path east.
After about a half hour,
they find a livestock field with a rudimentary fence that has been trampled.
A fixes the fence with some hard work. 

About a mile from the fence is a farmhouse with 2 sleeping ogres guarding it, 
and out back 3 ogres around a large fire cooking the displacer beast.
The gang perfectly execute an ambush, killing all 5.

They find 2600 CP, 1500 SP, 40 GP, and 7 gems worth 50 gp each.
The house is a grizzly scene, so they burn it. 

They continue north on the road.
The path further north has fields with some livestock (?).
They continue, and find a path west, leading to a farmhouse that is evidently not abandoned, 
but has nobody home.
They spend the night there, in relative comfort
(except S, who spends it in comfort in the owner's bed).

The following day the temperature dropped to 30 F below normal, 
i.e. below freezing. 
The party continued on 2 hours up the main road and found another path east.
They see two people on the path about a mile away who do not appear to be moving.

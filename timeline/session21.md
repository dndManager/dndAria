# Babysitting

Morning of the 4th day, 
the team heads toward Leafland.
They see two individuals down a trial to the east and start to approach,
but quickly realize they don't seem to be moving.

Alidris has studied petrification a bit and realizes that a number of animals 
can petrify including cockatrice, basilisk, and gorgon. 
He also remembers that there is a sixth level flesh-to-stone spell.

Team sends a badger from the bag of tricks to investigate but the badger 
disappears into the grass on
the right side past the statues and stops.
Team sends a giant rat from the bag of tricks to strut in front of the petrified
farmers. 
The rat does an incredible job avoiding and tanking hits while providing
Sevro with sneak attack.

The team finds a male and female farmer who have been petrified apparently this 
morning as their tracks are fresh.
Alidris takes hands, heads, feathers, and some eggs from within the hens bodies.

Venturing farther on the trail, 
the team finds a farmhouse with 3 children: 
boys aged 5 years and 6 months and a 3 year old girl. 
The team decides to bring these children (with their okay) to the neighbors house 
(a couple of miles away), 
but they find out from the children that it is likely the neighbors won't be 
back for a week.

The next morning Errich and Vargan decide to go get the cows 
(from the [ogre ransacked farm](20180218.html)) and bring them to
this farmhouse
while Alidris takes care of the kids and Sevro sits in a rocking chair on the 
porch.

Later that day the children's father comes running down the path.
Apparently the petrification only lasted 24 hours.
The team reunits the children with their parents and bring them 20 head of 
cattle with fencing.

The team heads to The Crossroads where a market is currently in progress. 
A gnome named Bart runs up to Sevro and says 
"hey man, what is going on? long time no see!".
